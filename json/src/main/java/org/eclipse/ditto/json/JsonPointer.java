/**
 * A JSON pointer defines a path within a JSON object. This path is hierarchical like a file tree. Thus each element of
 * this path is a sub level of it predecessor beginning at the root and ending at the leaf. For example, given the
 * following JSON object
 * <pre>
 *    {
 *       "thingId": "myThing",
 *       "attributes": {
 *          "location": {
 *             "latitude": 47.003215,
 *             "longitude": 9.0815
 *          }
 *       },
 *       "features": {}
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * The root of the JSON pointer {@code "/attributes/location/longitude"} is {@code "/attributes"} and the leaf is
 * {@code "longitude"}. This pointer points to the field with key {@code "longitude"} and value {@code 9.0815} of the
 * aforementioned JSON object.
 * <p>
 * <em>Implementations of this interface are required to be immutable!</em>
