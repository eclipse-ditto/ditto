 * A property search filter defines what property exactly is to be searched. For example if the goal is to search for a
 * threshold which is greater than some value, the following code creates an according search query:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    final SearchProperty thresholdProperty = SearchModelFactory.property("attributes/threshold");
 *    final PropertySearchFilter propertySearchFilter = thresholdProperty.gt(42.23);
 *
 *    final SearchQuery searchQuery = SearchModelFactory.newSearchQuery(propertySearchFilter);

 *
 * To define a more fine grained search, property search filters can be concatenated with the help
 * {@link LogicalSearchFilter} which are available through the {@link SearchModelFactory}.
