# Eclipse Ditto

> Eclipse Ditto is an open source digital twin framework for the IoT (Internet of Things). It implements the "digital twin" pattern, providing a cloud-based virtual representation of real-world devices (Things). Ditto exposes a fully-fledged, authorization-aware API (HTTP, WebSocket, and various messaging protocols) for interacting with digital twins, abstracting away the complexity of device connectivity. It is implemented in Java using a microservices architecture with Apache Pekko, event sourcing, and CQRS.

Eclipse Ditto provides five microservices (Things, Policies, Gateway, Connectivity, Things-Search) that communicate via Apache Pekko Cluster. It persists digital twin state using event sourcing, supports fine-grained authorization via Policies, and offers connectivity to devices through AMQP, MQTT, HTTP, Kafka, and Eclipse Hono protocol bindings. Ditto uses the RQL (Resource Query Language) for filtering and searching twins, supports change notifications via WebSocket and Server-Sent Events, and integrates with the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard. It can be deployed via Docker Compose or Helm charts on Kubernetes.
