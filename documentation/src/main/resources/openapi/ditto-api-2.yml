    JSON-based, REST-like API for Eclipse Ditto

    The Eclipse Ditto HTTP API uses response status codes (see [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6))
    to indicate whether a specific request has been successfully completed, or not.

    The information Ditto provides additionally to the status code (e.g. in API docs, or error codes like. "things:thing.tooLarge") might change without advance notice.
    These are not be considered as official API, and must therefore not be applied in your applications or tests.

        Returns all visible things or things passed in by the required parameter `ids`, which you (the authorized subject) are allowed to read.

        Optionally, if you want to retrieve only some of the thing's fields, you can use the specific field selectors (see parameter `fields`) .

        Tip: In order to formulate a `filter` which things to search for, take a look at the `/search` resource.

      summary: Create a new thing
      description: |-
        Creates a thing with a default `thingId` and a default `policyId`.

        The thing will be empty, i.e. no features, definition, attributes etc. by default.

        The default `thingId` consists of your default namespace and a UUID.

        The default `policyId` is identical with the default `thingId`, and allows the currently authorized subject all permissions.

        In case you need to create a thing with a specific ID, use a *PUT* request instead, as any `thingId` specified in the request body will be ignored.

        The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can
        be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.

    put:
      summary: Create or update a thing with a specified ID
      description: |-
        Create or update the thing specified by the `thingId` path parameter and the optional JSON body.

        * If you set a new `thingId` in the path, a thing will be created.
        * If you set an existing `thingId` in the path, the thing will be updated.


        ### Create a new thing
        At the initial creation of a thing, only a valid `thingId` is required.
        However, you can create a full-fledged thing all at once.

        ### Example:
        To create a coffee maker thing, set the `thingId` in the path, e.g. to "com.acme.coffeemaker:BE-42"
        and the body part, like in the following snippet.

        ```
         {
           "definition": "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0",
           "attributes": {
             "manufacturer": "ACME demo corp.",
             "location": "Berlin, main floor",
             "serialno": "42",
             "model": "Speaking coffee machine"
           },
           "features": {
             "coffee-brewer": {
               "definition": [ "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0" ],
               "properties": {
                 "brewed-coffees": 0
               }
             },
             "water-tank": {
               "properties": {
                 "configuration": {
                   "smartMode": true,
                   "brewingTemp": 87,
                   "tempToHold": 44,
                   "timeoutSeconds": 6000
                 },
                 "status": {
                   "waterAmount": 731,
                   "temperature": 44
                 }
               }
             }
           }
          }
         ```
        As the example does not set a policy in the request body, but the thing concept requires one,
        the service will create a default policy. The default policy, has the exactly same id
        as the thing, and grants ALL permissions to the authorized subject.

        In case you need to associate the new thing to an already existing policy you can additionally
        set a policy e.g. "policyId": "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-1" as the first element in the body part.
        Keep in mind, that you can also change the assignment to another policy anytime,
        with a request on the sub-resource "PUT /things/{thingId}/policyId"

        The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can
        be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.

        ### Update an existing thing

        For updating an existing thing, the authorized subject needs **WRITE** permission on the thing's root resource.

        The ID of a thing cannot be changed after creation. Any `thingId`
        specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

    patch:
      summary: Create or patch a thing with a specified ID
      description: |-
        Create or patch an existing thing specified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        If the thing did not yet exist, it will be created.
        For an existing thing, patching a thing will merge the provided request body with the existing thing values.
        This makes it possible to change only some parts of a thing in single request without providing the full thing
        structure in the request body.


        ### Patch a thing

        With this resource it is possible to add, update or delete parts of an existing thing or to create the thing if it
        does not yet exist.
        The request body provided in *JSON merge patch* (RFC-7396) format will be merged with the existing thing.
        Notice that the `null` value in the JSON body will delete the specified JSON key from the thing.
        For further documentation of JSON merge patch see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).


        ### Example
        A Thing already exists with the following content:

        ```
        {
          "definition": "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0",
          "attributes": {
            "manufacturer": "ACME demo corp.",
            "location": "Berlin, main floor",
            "serialno": "42",
            "model": "Speaking coffee machine"
          },
          "features": {
            "coffee-brewer": {
              "definition": ["com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"],
              "properties": {
                "brewed-coffees": 0
              }
            },
            "water-tank": {
              "properties": {
                "configuration": {
                  "smartMode": true,
                  "brewingTemp": 87,
                  "tempToHold": 44,
                  "timeoutSeconds": 6000
                },
                "status": {
                  "waterAmount": 731,
                  "temperature": 44
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        To make changes that only affect parts of the existing thing, e.g. add some attribute and delete a
        specific feature property, the content of the request body could look like this:

        ```
        {
          "attributes": {
            "manufacturingYear": "2020"
          },
          "features": {
            "water-tank": {
              "properties": {
                "configuration": {
                  "smartMode": null,
                  "tempToHold": 50,
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        The request body will be merged with the existing thing and the result will be the following thing:

        ```
        {
          "definition": "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0",
          "attributes": {
            "manufacturer": "ACME demo corp.",
            "manufacturingYear": "2020",
            "location": "Berlin, main floor",
            "serialno": "42",
            "model": "Speaking coffee machine"
          },
          "features": {
            "coffee-brewer": {
              "definition": ["com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"],
              "properties": {
                "brewed-coffees": 0
              }
            },
            "water-tank": {
              "properties": {
                "configuration": {
                  "brewingTemp": 87,
                  "tempToHold": 50,
                  "timeoutSeconds": 6000
                },
                "status": {
                  "waterAmount": 731,
                  "temperature": 44
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Permissions for patching an existing Thing

        For updating an existing thing, the authorized subject needs **WRITE** permission on those parts of the thing
        that are affected by the merge update.

        For example, to successfully execute the above example the authorized subject needs to have unrestricted
        *WRITE* permissions on all affected paths of the JSON merge patch: `attributes/manufacturingYear`,
        `features/water-tank/properties/configuration/smartMode`,
        `features/water-tank/properties/configuration/tempToHold`. The *WRITE* permission must not be revoked on any
        level further down the hierarchy. Consequently it is also sufficient for the authorized subject to have
        unrestricted *WRITE* permission at root level or unrestricted *WRITE* permission at `/attributes` and
        `/features` etc.

        Create or modify all features of a thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        ### Create all features at once
        In case at the initial creation of your thing you have not specified any features, these can be created here.

        ### Update all features at once
        To update all features at once prepare the JSON body accordingly.

        Note: In contrast to the "PUT thing" request, a partial update is not supported here,
        but the content will be **overwritten**.
        If you need to update single features or their paths, please use the sub-resources instead.

          JSON object of all features to be modified at once. Consider that the value has to be a JSON object or null.

          Examples:
          * an empty object: {} - would just delete all old features
          * an empty feature: { "featureId": {} } - We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters
            for the `featureId`, as it might be needed for the (URL) path later.

            Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9-]*

          * a nested object with multiple features as shown in the example value field
        required: true
    patch:
      summary: Patch all features of a specific thing
      description: |-
        Patch all features of a thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        The existing features will be merged with the JSON content set in the request body.

        Notice that the `null` value has a special meaning and can be used to delete specific features from the thing.
        For further documentation see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

        **Note**: In contrast to the "PUT thing/{thingId}/features" request, a partial update is supported here
        and request body is merged with the existing features.

        ### Example

        The following example will add/update the properties `brewed-coffees`, `tempToHold` and `failState`.
        The configuration property `smartMode` will be deleted from the thing.


        ```
        {
          "coffee-brewer": {
            "properties": {
              "brewed-coffees": 10
            }
          },
          "water-tank": {
            "properties": {
              "configuration": {
                "smartMode": null,
                "tempToHold": 50,
              },
              "status": {
                "failState": true
              }
            }
          }
        }

        Patch a specific feature identified by the `featureId` path parameter of a thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        The existing feature will be merged with the JSON content set in the request body.

        Notice that the `null` value can be used to delete the whole feature or specific parts of it.
        For further documentation see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

        **Note**: In contrast to the "PUT things/{thingId}/features/{featureId}" request,
        a partial update is supported here and request body is merged with the existing feature.

        ### Example

        Set the `featureId` to **coffee-brewer** and all properties in the body part
        to update the `brewed-coffees` property and delete the definition.

        ```
        {
          "definition": null,
          "properties": {
            "brewed-coffees": 42

    post:
      summary: Initiates claiming a specific thing in order to gain access
      description: |-
        ### Why
        A claiming process may enable an end-user to claim things and proof ownership thereof.
        Such a process is initially triggered via a claim message.
        This message can be sent to the things service with the HTTP API or the things-client.

        ### How
        At this resource you can send a "claim" message to the thing identified
        by the `thingId` path parameter in order to gain access to it. The "claim" message is forwarded
        together with the request body and `Content-Type` header to client(s)
        which registered for Claim messages of the specific thing.

        The decision whether to grant access (by setting permissions) is
        completely up to the client(s) which handle the "claim" message.

        The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.
        By default, it blocks until a response to the issued "claim" message is
        available or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
        will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

        ### Who
        No special permission is required to issue a claim message.

        ### Example
        See [Claiming](https://www.eclipse.dev/ditto/protocol-specification-things-messages.html#sending-and-handling-claim-messages) concept in detail and example in GitHub.
        However, in that scenario, the policy should grant you READ and WRITE permission on
        the "message:/" resource in order to be able to send the message and read the response.
        Further, the things-client which handles the "claim" message, needs permission to change the policy itself
        (i.e. READ and WRITE permission on the "policy:/" resource).

      summary: Send a message TO a specific thing
      description: |-
        ### Why
        A message can be sent to a thing or one of its features in order to invoke an operation on the device.

        ### How
        Send a message with a `messageSubject` **to** the thing
        identified by the `thingId` path parameter. The request body contains
        the message payload and the `Content-Type` header defines its type.

        The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.
        By default, it blocks until a response to the message is available
        or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
        a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
        will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

        ### Who
        You will need `WRITE` permission on the root "message:/" resource, or at least
        the resource `message:/inbox/messages/messageSubject`. The receiving device needs `READ` permission on the resource.
        Such permission is managed within the policy which controls the access on the thing.

        ### Example
        Given you have a "coffemaker" thing as shown in the examples for the `things` resources.
        The `messageSubject` understood by such a device would be "makeCoffee".

        Further, as in our example the "brewed-coffees" counter would increase as a response, you would need `WRITE`
        permission for the things resource, at least at the respective path

      summary: Send a message FROM a specific feature of a specific thing
      description: |-
        Send a message with the subject `messageSubject` **from** the feature
        specified by the `featureId` and `thingId` path parameter. The request
        body contains the message payload and the `Content-Type` header defines
        its type.

        The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.
        By default, it blocks until a response to the message is available
        or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
        a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
        will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

        ### Who
        You will need `WRITE` permission on the root "message:/" resource, or at least
        the resource `message:/features/featureId/outbox/messages/messageSubject`.
        Such permission is managed  within the policy which controls the access on the thing.

        Tip: If you don't know the policy ID of a thing, request it via GET `/things/{thingId}`.

        Optionally, you can use the field selectors (see parameter `fields`) to only get specific fields,
        which you are interested in.

        ### Example:
        Use the field selector `_revision` to retrieve the revision of the policy.

        Create or update the policy specified by the policyId path parameter.
        * If you set a new policyId in the path, a new policy will be created.
        * If you set an existing policyId in the path, the policy will be updated.

        ### Create a new policy
        At the initial creation of a policy, at least one valid entry is required. However, you can create a full-fledged policy all at once.

        By default the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the root resource of the created policy. You can
        however omit this check by setting the parameter `allow-policy-lockout` to `true`.

        Example: To create a policy for multiple coffee maker things,
        which gives **yourself** all permissions on all resources, set the policyId in the path,
        e.g. to "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" and the body part, like in the following snippet.

        ```
        {
          "entries": {
            "DEFAULT": {
              "subjects": {
                "{{ request:subjectId }}": {
                  "type": "the creator"
                }
              },
              "resources": {
                "policy:/": {
                  "grant": [
                    "READ",
                    "WRITE"
                  ],
                  "revoke": []
                },
                "thing:/": {
                  "grant": [
                    "READ",
                    "WRITE"
                  ],
                  "revoke": []
                },
                "message:/": {
                  "grant": [
                    "READ",
                    "WRITE"
                  ],
                  "revoke": []
                }
              }
            }
          },
          "imports": {
            "com.acme:importedPolicy" : {
              "entries": [ "IMPORTED" ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Update an existing policy
        For updating an existing policy, the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the policy's root resource.

        The ID of a policy cannot be changed after creation. Any `policyId` specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

        ### Partially update an existing policy
        Partial updates are not supported.

        If you need to create or update a specific label, resource, or subject, please use the respective sub-resources.

      summary: Activate subjects for this policy derived from the token
      description: |-
        **This action only works when authenticated with a Json Web Token (JWT).**

        Based on the authenticated token (JWT), **for each policy entry** matching those conditions:
        * the authenticated token is granted the `EXECUTE` permission to perform the `activateTokenIntegration` action
        * one of the subject IDs is contained in the authenticated token
        * at least one `READ` permission to a `thing:/` resource path is granted

        a new subject is **injected into the matched policy entry** calculated with information extracted from the
        authenticated JWT.

        The injected subjects expire when the JWT expires. The `expiry` timestamp (a string in ISO-8601 format)
        specifies how long the specific subject will have access to the resource secured by the policy.
        The subject will be automatically deleted from the policy once this timestamp is reached.
        To give the subject a chance to prolong the access he can configure a connection to get announcements.
        Policy announcements are published to websockets and connections that have the relevant subject ID.

        The settings under `announcement` control when a policy announcement is published (before expiry or when deleted).
        If the field `requestedAcks` is set, then the announcements are published with at-least-once delivery until
        the acknowledgement requests under labels are fulfilled.
        If a "beforeExpiry" announcement was sent without acknowledgement requests, or the a "beforeExpiry"
        announcement was acknowledged, the "whenDeleted" announcement will not be triggered.

          Given your policy "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" only has the
          DEFAULT entry, and you want to add a "Consumer" section which additionally allows USER-01
          (managed within a Nginx reverse proxy) to

        The injected subjects expire when the JWT expires. The `expiry` timestamp (a string in ISO-8601 format)

        The subject will be automatically deleted from the policy once this timestamp is reached.
        To give the subject a chance to prolong the access he can configure a connection to get announcements.
        Policy announcements are published to websockets and connections that have the relevant subject ID.

        The settings under `announcement` control when a policy announcement is published (before expiry or when deleted).
        If the field `requestedAcks` is set, then the announcements are published with at-least-once delivery until
        the acknowledgement requests under labels are fulfilled.
        If a "beforeExpiry" announcement was sent without acknowledgement requests, or the a "beforeExpiry"
        announcement was acknowledged, the "whenDeleted" announcement will not be triggered.

        This resource can be used to search for things.

        * The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set, the
          result contains all things which the logged in user is allowed to read.

        * The search is case sensitive. In case you don't know how exactly the
          spelling of value of the namespace, name, attribute, feature etc. is, use the *like*
          notation instead of *eq* for filtering.

        * The resource supports sorting and paging. If paging is not explicitly
          specified by means of the `size` option, a default count of `25`
          documents is returned.

        * The internal search index is "eventually consistent".  Consistency with the latest
          thing updates should recover within milliseconds.
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/SearchFilter'

            Possible values for the parameter:

            #### Sort operations

            * ```sort([+|-]{property})```
            * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```

            #### Paging operations

            * ```size({page-size})```  Maximum allowed page size is `200`. Default page size is `25`.
            * ```cursor({cursor-id})```  Start the search from the cursor location. Specify the cursor ID without
            quotation marks. Cursor IDs are given in search responses and mark the position after the last entry of
            the previous search. The meaning of cursor IDs is unspecified and may change without notice.

            The paging option `limit({offset},{count})` is deprecated.
            It may result in slow queries or timeouts and will be removed eventually.

            #### Examples:

            * ```sort(+thingId)```
            * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```size(10)``` return 10 results
            * ```cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```  return results after the position of the cursor `LOREMIPSUM`.

            #### Combine:

            If you need to specify multiple options, when using the swagger UI just write each option in a new line.
            When using the plain REST API programmatically,
            you will need to separate the options using a comma (,) character.

            ```size(200),cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```

            The deprecated paging option `limit` may not be combined with the other paging options `size` and `cursor`.

                    Contains a comma-separated list of fields to be included in the returned
                    JSON. attributes can be selected in the same manner.

                    #### Selectable fields

                    * `thingId`
                    * `policyId`
                    * `definition`
                    * `attributes`

                       Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields by using a comma-separated list:
                        * several attribute paths can be passed as a comma-separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

                          For example:
                            * `?fields=attributes/model` would select only `model` attribute value (if present)
                            * `?fields=attributes/model,attributes/location` would select only `model` and
                               `location` attribute values (if present)

                      Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields inside parentheses `( )`:
                        * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901)
                          separated with `/`) to select

                        * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions
                          in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

                          For example:
                           * `?fields=attributes(model,location)` would select only `model`
                              and `location` attribute values (if present)
                           * `?fields=attributes(coffeemaker/serialno)` would select the `serialno` value
                              inside the `coffeemaker` object
                           * `?fields=attributes/address/postal(city,street)` would select the `city` and
                              `street` values inside the `postal` object inside the `address` object

                    * `features`

                      Supports selecting arbitrary fields in features similar to `attributes` (see also features documentation for more details)

                    * `_namespace`

                      Specifically selects the namespace also contained in the `thingId`

                    * `_revision`

                      Specifically selects the revision of the thing. The revision is a counter, which is incremented on each modification of a thing.

                    * `_created`

                      Specifically selects the created timestamp of the thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on creation of a thing.

                    * `_modified`

                      Specifically selects the modified timestamp of the thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on each modification of a thing.

                    * `_metadata`

                      Specifically selects the Metadata of the thing. The content is a JSON object having the Thing's JSON structure with the difference that the JSON leaves of the Thing are JSON objects containing the metadata.

                    * `_policy`

                      Specifically selects the content of the policy associated to the thing. (By default, only the policyId is returned.)

                    #### Examples

                    * `?fields=thingId,attributes,features`
                    * `?fields=attributes(model,manufacturer),features`
                  type: string

                    Possible values for the parameter:

                    #### Sort operations

                    * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```

                    #### Paging operations

                    * ```size({page-size})```  Maximum allowed page size is `200`. Default page size is `25`.
                    * ```cursor({cursor-id})```  Start the search from the cursor location. Specify the cursor ID without

                    the previous search. The meaning of cursor IDs is unspecified and may change without notice.

                    The paging option `limit({offset},{count})` is deprecated.
                    It may result in slow queries or timeouts and will be removed eventually.

                    #### Examples:

                    * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```
                    * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```
                    * ```size(10)``` return 10 results
                    * ```cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```  return results after the position of the cursor `LOREMIPSUM`.

                  description: |-
                    Similar to the `filter`, a `condition` may be passed to ensure strong consistency when querying things.

                    This `condition` has the same syntax and semantics than the `filter` - it is however applied on the matched things
                    selected by the `filter` - on their current state.

                    So combining this together with `filter` can provide strong consistency when performing a search.

        Provides an endpoint accepting [CloudEvents via its HTTP protocol binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/http-protocol-binding.md)

        The endpoint can also directly be configured as a [Knative eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/) destination.

        Find more documentation on that [here](https://www.eclipse.dev/ditto/httpapi-protocol-bindings-cloudevents.html).

        acknowledgements via the `requested-acks` param. Can be specified without unit (then seconds are assumed) or
        together with `s`, `ms` or `m` unit. Example: `42s`, `1m`.

        The default (if omitted) and maximum timeout is `60s`. A value of `0` applies fire and forget semantics for
        the command resulting in setting `response-required=false`.

            This field may contain
            * the policy ID of an existing policy.

              The policy is copied and used for this newly created thing. The
              caller needs to have READ and WRITE<sup>*</sup> access to the policy.
            * a placeholder reference to a thing in the format {{ ref:things/[thingId]/policyId }} where you need to
              replace [thingId] with a valid thing ID.

              The newly created thing will then obtain a copy of the policy of
              the referenced thing. The caller needs to have READ access to the thing and READ and WRITE<sup>*</sup>
              access to the policy of the thing.


            <sup>*</sup> The check for WRITE permission avoids locking yourself out of the newly created policy. You can
            bypass this check by setting the header `allowPolicyLockout` to `true`. Be aware that the authorized
            subject cannot modify the policy if you do not assign WRITE permission on the policy resource!

            If you want to specify a policy ID for the copied policy, use the policyId field.

            This field must not be used together with the field _policy. If you specify both _policy and _copyPolicyFrom
            this will lead to an error response.

    SearchFilterProperty:
      description: |-

        #### Filter predicates:

        * ```eq({property},{value})```  (i.e. equal to the given value)

        * ```ne({property},{value})```  (i.e. not equal to the given value)

        * ```gt({property},{value})```  (i.e. greater than the given value)

        * ```ge({property},{value})```  (i.e. equal to the given value or greater than it)

        * ```lt({property},{value})```  (i.e. lower than the given value or equal to it)

        * ```le({property},{value})```  (i.e. lower than the given value)

        * ```in({property},{value},{value},...)```  (i.e. contains at least one of the values listed)

        * ```like({property},{value})```  (i.e. contains values similar to the expressions listed)

        * ```ilike({property},{value})```  (i.e. contains values similar and case insensitive to the expressions listed)

        * ```exists({property})```  (i.e. all things in which the given path exists)


        Note: When using filter operations, only things with the specified properties are returned.
        For example, the filter `ne(attributes/owner, "SID123")` will only return things that do have
        the `owner` attribute.


        #### Logical operations:


        * ```and({query},{query},...)```

        * ```or({query},{query},...)```

        * ```not({query})```


        #### Examples:

        * ```eq(attributes/location,"kitchen")```

        * ```ge(thingId,"myThing1")```

        * ```gt(_created,"2020-08-05T12:17")```

        * ```exists(features/featureId)```

        * ```and(eq(attributes/location,"kitchen"),eq(attributes/color,"red"))```

        * ```or(eq(attributes/location,"kitchen"),eq(attributes/location,"living-room"))```

        * ```like(attributes/key1,"known-chars-at-start*")```

        * ```like(attributes/key1,"*known-chars-at-end")```

        * ```like(attributes/key1,"*known-chars-in-between*")```

        * ```like(attributes/key1,"just-som?-char?-unkn?wn")```

        The `like` filters with the wildcard `*` at the beginning can slow down your search request.

    NamespaceProperty:
      description: |-
        A comma-separated list of namespaces. This list is used to limit the query to things in the given namespaces

        * `?namespaces=com.example.namespace`

        * `?namespaces=com.example.namespace1,com.example.namespace2`
