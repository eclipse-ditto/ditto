    JSON-based, REST-like API for Eclipse Ditto

    The Eclipse Ditto HTTP API uses response status codes (see [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6))
    to indicate whether a specific request has been successfully completed, or not.

    The information Ditto provides additionally to the status code (e.g. in API docs, or error codes like. "things:thing.tooLarge") might change without advance notice.
    These are not be considered as official API, and must therefore not be applied in your applications or tests.

      summary: Retrieve multiple things with specified IDs
      description: |-
        Returns all things passed in by the required parameter `ids`, which you (the authorized subject) are allowed to read.

        Optionally, if you want to retrieve only some of the thing's fields, you can use the specific field selectors (see parameter `fields`) .

        Tip: If you don't know the thing IDs, start with the search resource.

      summary: Create a new thing
      description: |-
        Creates a thing with a default `thingId` and a default `policyId`.

        The thing will be empty, i.e. no features, definition, attributes etc. by default.

        The default `thingId` consists of your default namespace and a UUID.

        The default `policyId` is identical with the default `thingId`, and allows the currently authorized subject all permissions.

        In case you need to create a thing with a specific ID, use a *PUT* request instead, as any `thingId` specified in the request body will be ignored.

        The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can
        be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.

    put:
      summary: Create or update a thing with a specified ID
      description: |-
        Create or update the thing specified by the `thingId` path parameter and the optional JSON body.

        * If you set a new `thingId` in the path, a thing will be created.
        * If you set an existing `thingId` in the path, the thing will be updated.


        ### Create a new thing
        At the initial creation of a thing, only a valid `thingId` is required.
        However, you can create a full-fledged thing all at once.

        ### Example:
        To create a coffee maker thing, set the `thingId` in the path, e.g. to "com.acme.coffeemaker:BE-42"
        and the body part, like in the following snippet.

        ```
         {
           "definition": "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0",
           "attributes": {
             "manufacturer": "ACME demo corp.",
             "location": "Berlin, main floor",
             "serialno": "42",
             "model": "Speaking coffee machine"
           },
           "features": {
             "coffee-brewer": {
               "definition": [ "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0" ],
               "properties": {
                 "brewed-coffees": 0
               }
             },
             "water-tank": {
               "properties": {
                 "configuration": {
                   "smartMode": true,
                   "brewingTemp": 87,
                   "tempToHold": 44,
                   "timeoutSeconds": 6000
                 },
                 "status": {
                   "waterAmount": 731,
                   "temperature": 44
                 }
               }
             }
           }
          }
         ```
        As the example does not set a policy in the request body, but the thing concept requires one,
        the service will create a default policy. The default policy, has the exactly same id
        as the thing, and grants ALL permissions to the authorized subject.

        In case you need to associate the new thing to an already existing policy you can additionally
        set a policy e.g. "policyId": "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-1" as the first element in the body part.
        Keep in mind, that you can also change the assignment to another policy anytime,
        with a request on the sub-resource "PUT /things/{thingId}/policyId"

        The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can
        be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.

        ### Update an existing thing

        For updating an existing thing, the authorized subject needs **WRITE** permission on the thing's root resource.

        The ID of a thing cannot be changed after creation. Any `thingId`
        specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

      summary: Patch a thing with a specified ID
      description: |-
        Patch an existing thing specified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        Patching a thing will merge the provided request body with the exisiting thing.
        This makes it possible to change only some parts of a thing in single request without providing the full thing
        structure in the request body.


        ### Patch a thing

        With this resource it is possible to add, update or delete parts of an existing thing.
        The request body provided in *JSON merge patch* (RFC-7396) format will be merged with the existing thing.
        Notice that the `null` value in the JSON body will delete the specified JSON key from the thing.
        For further documentation of JSON merge patch see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).


        ### Example
        A Thing already exists with the following content:

        ```
        {
          "definition": "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0",
          "attributes": {
            "manufacturer": "ACME demo corp.",
            "location": "Berlin, main floor",
            "serialno": "42",
            "model": "Speaking coffee machine"
          },
          "features": {
            "coffee-brewer": {
              "definition": ["com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"],
              "properties": {
                "brewed-coffees": 0
              }
            },
            "water-tank": {
              "properties": {
                "configuration": {
                  "smartMode": true,
                  "brewingTemp": 87,
                  "tempToHold": 44,
                  "timeoutSeconds": 6000
                },
                "status": {
                  "waterAmount": 731,
                  "temperature": 44
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        To make changes that only affect parts of the existing thing, e.g. add some attribute and delete a
        specific feature property, the content of the request body could look like this:

        ```
        {
          "attributes": {
            "manufacturingYear": "2020"
          },
          "features": {
            "water-tank": {
              "properties": {
                "configuration": {
                  "smartMode": null,
                  "tempToHold": 50,
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        The request body will be merged with the existing thing and the result will be the following thing:

        ```
        {
          "definition": "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0",
          "attributes": {
            "manufacturer": "ACME demo corp.",
            "manufacturingYear": "2020",
            "location": "Berlin, main floor",
            "serialno": "42",
            "model": "Speaking coffee machine"
          },
          "features": {
            "coffee-brewer": {
              "definition": ["com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"],
              "properties": {
                "brewed-coffees": 0
              }
            },
            "water-tank": {
              "properties": {
                "configuration": {
                  "brewingTemp": 87,
                  "tempToHold": 50,
                  "timeoutSeconds": 6000
                },
                "status": {
                  "waterAmount": 731,
                  "temperature": 44
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Permissions for patching an existing Thing

        For updating an existing thing, the authorized subject needs **WRITE** permission on those parts of the thing
        that are affected by the merge update.

        For example, to successfully execute the above example the authorized subject needs to have unrestricted
        *WRITE* permissions on all affected paths of the JSON merge patch: `attributes/manufacturingYear`,
        `features/water-tank/properties/configuration/smartMode`,
        `features/water-tank/properties/configuration/tempToHold`. The *WRITE* permission must not be revoked on any
        level further down the hierarchy. Consequently it is also sufficient for the authorized subject to have
        unrestricted *WRITE* permission at root level or unrestricted *WRITE* permission at `/attributes` and
        `/features` etc.

        Patch a specific attribute of a thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        * If you specify a new attribute path, this will be created
        * If you specify an existing attribute path, this will be merged
        * If you set the request body to `null` for an existing attribute path then the attribute will be deleted.
          For further documentation see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

        The attribute (JSON) can be referenced hierarchically, by applying JSON Pointer notation (RFC-6901).

        ### Example:

        In order to patch the `name` field of an `manufacturer` attribute, the full path would be
        `/things/{thingId}/attributes/manufacturer/name`

        Create or modify all features of a thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        ### Create all features at once
        In case at the initial creation of your thing you have not specified any features, these can be created here.

        ### Update all features at once
        To update all features at once prepare the JSON body accordingly.

        Note: In contrast to the "PUT thing" request, a partial update is not supported here,
        but the content will be **overwritten**.
        If you need to update single features or their paths, please use the sub-resources instead.

        ### Example:

        ```
        {
             "coffee-brewer": {

          Examples:
          * an empty object: {} - would just delete all old features
          * an empty feature: { "featureId": {} } - We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters
            for the `featureId`, as it might be needed for the (URL) path later.

            Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9-]*

    patch:
      summary: Patch all features of a specific thing
      description: |-
        Patch all features of a thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

        The existing features will be merged with the JSON content set in the request body.

        Notice that the `null` value has a special meaning and can be used to delete specific features from the thing.
        For further documentation see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

        **Note**: In contrast to the "PUT thing/{thingId}/features" request, a partial update is supported here
        and request body is merged with the existing features.

        ### Example

        The following example will add/update the properties `brewed-coffees`, `tempToHold` and `failState`.
        The configuration property `smartMode` will be deleted from the thing.


        ```
        {
          "coffee-brewer": {
            "properties": {
              "brewed-coffees": 10

                "tempToHold": 50,
              },
              "status": {
                "failState": true
              }
            }

  '/things/{thingId}/inbox/claim':
    post:
      summary: Initiates claiming a specific thing in order to gain access
      description: |-
        ### Why
        A claiming process may enable an end-user to claim things and proof ownership thereof.
        Such a process is initially triggered via a claim message.
        This message can be sent to the things service with the HTTP API or the things-client.

        ### How
        At this resource you can send a "claim" message to the thing identified
        by the `thingId` path parameter in order to gain access to it. The "claim" message is forwarded
        together with the request body and `Content-Type` header to client(s)
        which registered for Claim messages of the specific thing.

        The decision whether to grant access (by setting permissions) is
        completely up to the client(s) which handle the "claim" message.

        The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.
        By default, it blocks until a response to the issued "claim" message is
        available or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
        will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

        ### Who
        No special permission is required to issue a claim message.

        ### Example
        See [Claiming](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-specification-things-messages.html#sending-and-handling-claim-messages) concept in detail and example in GitHub.
        However, in that scenario, the policy should grant you READ and WRITE permission on
        the "message:/" resource in order to be able to send the message and read the response.
        Further, the things-client which handles the "claim" message, needs permission to change the policy itself
        (i.e. READ and WRITE permission on the "policy:/" resource).

      summary: Send a message TO a specific thing
      description: |-
        ### Why
        A message can be sent to a thing or one of its features in order to invoke an operation on the device.

        ### How
        Send a message with a `messageSubject` **to** the thing
        identified by the `thingId` path parameter. The request body contains
        the message payload and the `Content-Type` header defines its type.

        The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.
        By default, it blocks until a response to the message is available
        or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
        a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
        will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

        ### Who
        You will need `WRITE` permission on the root "message:/" resource, or at least
        the resource `message:/inbox/messages/messageSubject`. The receiving device needs `READ` permission on the resource.
        Such permission is managed within the policy which controls the access on the thing.

        ### Example
        Given you have a "coffemaker" thing as shown in the examples for the `things` resources.
        The `messageSubject` understood by such a device would be "makeCoffee".

        Further, as in our example the "brewed-coffees" counter would increase as a response, you would need `WRITE`
        permission for the things resource, at least at the respective path

        `/things/{thingId}/features/coffee-brewer/properties/brewed-coffees`

        Create or update the policy specified by the policyId path parameter.
        * If you set a new policyId in the path, a new policy will be created.
        * If you set an existing policyId in the path, the policy will be updated.

        ### Create a new policy
        At the initial creation of a policy, at least one valid entry is required. However, you can create a full-fledged policy all at once.

        By default the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the root resource of the created policy. You can
        however omit this check by setting the parameter `allow-policy-lockout` to `true`.

        Example: To create a policy for multiple coffee maker things,
        which gives **yourself** all permissions on all resources, set the policyId in the path,
        e.g. to "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" and the body part, like in the following snippet.

        ```
        {
          "entries": {
            "DEFAULT": {

        ### Update an existing policy
        For updating an existing policy, the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the policy's root resource.

        The ID of a policy cannot be changed after creation. Any `policyId` specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

        ### Partially update an existing policy
        Partial updates are not supported.

        If you need to create or update a specific label, resource, or subject, please use the respective sub-resources.

          Given your policy "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" only has the

          (managed within a Nginx reverse proxy) to
          *read* the thing and to trigger a "makeCoffee" operation (i.e. POST such a message - see
          POST /things/{thingId}/inbox/messages/{messageSubject}).
          Set the label value to **Consumer** and the following request body:
          ```
          {
            "subjects": {
              "nginx:USER-01": {
                "type": "pre authenticated user from nginx"

        The subject will be automatically deleted from the policy once this timestamp is reached.

        Policy announcements are published to websockets and connections that have the relevant subject ID.

        If the field `requestedAcks` is set, then the announcements are published with at-least-once delivery until

      summary: Search for things
      description: |-
        This resource can be used to search for things.

        * The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set, the
          result contains all things which the logged in user is allowed to read.

        * The search is case sensitive. In case you don't know how exactly the
          spelling of value of the namespace, name, attribute, feature etc. is, use the *like*
          notation instead of *eq* for filtering.

        * The resource supports sorting and paging. If paging is not explicitly
          specified by means of the `size` option, a default count of `25`
          documents is returned.

        * The internal search index is "eventually consistent".  Consistency with the latest
          thing updates should recover within milliseconds.
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/SearchFilter'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/NamespacesFilter'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ThingFieldsQueryParam'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/TimeoutParam'
        - name: option
          in: query
          description: |-
            Possible values for the parameter:

            #### Sort operations

            * ```sort([+|-]{property})```
            * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```

            #### Paging operations

            * ```size({page-size})```  Maximum allowed page size is `200`. Default page size is `25`.
            * ```cursor({cursor-id})```  Start the search from the cursor location. Specify the cursor ID without
            quotation marks. Cursor IDs are given in search responses and mark the position after the last entry of
            the previous search. The meaning of cursor IDs is unspecified and may change without notice.

            The paging option `limit({offset},{count})` is deprecated.
            It may result in slow queries or timeouts and will be removed eventually.

            #### Examples:

            * ```sort(+thingId)```
            * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```size(10)``` return 10 results
            * ```cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```  return results after the position of the cursor `LOREMIPSUM`.

            #### Combine:

            If you need to specify multiple options, when using the swagger UI just write each option in a new line.
            When using the plain REST API programmatically,
            you will need to separate the options using a comma (,) character.

            ```size(200),cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```

            The deprecated paging option `limit` may not be combined with the other paging options `size` and `cursor`.

            * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions
              in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

              For example:
               * `?fields=attributes(model,location)` would select only `model`
                  and `location` attribute values (if present)

        * `features`

          Supports selecting arbitrary fields in features similar to `attributes` (see also features documentation for more details)

        * `_namespace`

          Specifically selects the namespace also contained in the `thingId`

        * `_revision`

          Specifically selects the revision of the thing. The revision is a counter, which is incremented on each modification of a thing.

        * `_created`

          Specifically selects the created timestamp of the thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on creation of a thing.

        * `_modified`

          Specifically selects the modified timestamp of the thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on each modification of a thing.

        * `_metadata`

          Specifically selects the Metadata of the thing. The content is a JSON object having the Thing's JSON structure with the difference that the JSON leaves of the Thing are JSON objects containing the metadata.

        * `_policy`

          Specifically selects the content of the policy associated to the thing. (By default, only the policyId is returned.)

            * a placeholder reference to a thing in the format {{ ref:things/[thingId]/policyId }} where you need to
              replace [thingId] with a valid thing ID.

              The newly created thing will then obtain a copy of the policy of
              the referenced thing. The caller needs to have READ access to the thing and READ and WRITE<sup>*</sup>
              access to the policy of the thing.


            <sup>*</sup> The check for WRITE permission avoids locking yourself out of the newly created policy. You can
            bypass this check by setting the header `allowPolicyLockout` to `true`. Be aware that the authorized
            subject cannot modify the policy if you do not assign WRITE permission on the policy resource!

            If you want to specify a policy ID for the copied policy, use the policyId field.

            This field must not be used together with the field _policy. If you specify both _policy and _copyPolicyFrom
            this will lead to an error response.
