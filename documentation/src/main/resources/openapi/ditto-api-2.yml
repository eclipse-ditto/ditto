    JSON-based, REST-like API for Eclipse Ditto

    The Eclipse Ditto HTTP API uses response status codes (see [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6))
    to indicate whether a specific request has been successfully completed, or not.

    However, the descriptions we provide additionally to the status code (e.g. in our API docs, or error codes like. "things.entitiy.tooLarge") might change without advance notice. These are not be considered as official API, and must therefore not be applied in your applications or tests.

        Returns all things passed in by the required parameter `ids`, which you (the authorized subject) are allowed to read.

        Optionally, if you want to retrieve only some of the thing's fields, you can use the specific field selectors (see parameter `fields`) .

        Tip: If you don't know the thing IDs, start with the search resource.

      summary: Create a new thing
      description: |-
        Creates a thing with a default `thingId` and a default `policyId`.

        The thing will be empty, i.e. no features, definition, attributes etc. by default.

        The default `thingId` consists of your default namespace and a UUID.

        The default `policyId` is identical with the default `thingId`, and allows the currently authorized subject all permissions.

        In case you need to create a thing with a specific ID, use a *PUT* request instead, as any `thingId` specified in the request body will be ignored.

        The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can
        be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.

      description: |-
        Create or update the thing specified by the `thingId` path parameter and
        the optional JSON body.

        * If you set a new `thingId` in the path, a thing will be created.
        * If you set an existing `thingId` in the path, the thing will be updated.


        ### Create a new thing
        At the initial creation of a thing, only a valid `thingId` is required.
        However, you can create a full-fledged thing all at once.

        Example:
        To create a coffee maker thing, set the `thingId` in the path, e.g. to "com.acme.coffeemaker:BE-42"
        and the body part, like in the following snippet.

        ```
         {
           "definition": "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0",
           "attributes": {
             "manufacturer": "ACME demo corp.",
             "location": "Berlin, main floor",
             "serialno": "42",
             "model": "Speaking coffee machine"
           },
           "features": {
             "coffee-brewer": {
               "definition": [ "com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0" ],
               "properties": {
                 "brewed-coffees": 0
               }
             },
             "water-tank": {
               "properties": {
                 "configuration": {
                   "smartMode": true,
                   "brewingTemp": 87,
                   "tempToHold": 44,
                   "timeoutSeconds": 6000
                 },
                 "status": {
                   "waterAmount": 731,
                   "temperature": 44
                 }
               }
             }
           }
          }
         ```
        As the example does not set a policy in the request body, but the thing concept requires one,
        the service will create a default policy. The default policy, has the exactly same id
        as the thing, and grants ALL permissions to the authorized subject.

        In case you need to associate the new thing to an already existing policy you can additionally
        set a policy e.g. "policyId": "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-1" as the first element in the body part.
        Keep in mind, that you can also change the assignment to another policy anytime,
        with a request on the sub-resource "PUT /things/{thingId}/policyId"

        The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can
        be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.

        ### Update an existing thing

        For updating an existing thing, the authorized subject needs **WRITE** permission on the thing's root resource.

        The ID of a thing cannot be changed after creation. Any `thingId`
        specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

        ### Partially update an existing thing

        When updating an existing thing, which already contains `attributes`, `definition` `policyId` or `features`,
        the existing fields must not explicitly be provided again.
        For this "PUT thing" request - and only for this top-level update on the thing -
        the top-level field to update is **merged** with the existing top-level fields of the thing.

        ### Example for a partial update

        Given, a thing already exists with this content:

        ```
        {
          "thingId": "namespace:thing-name",
          "policyId": "namespace:policy-name",
          "definition": "namespace:model:version",
          "attributes": {
            "foo": 1
          },
          "features": {...}
        }
        ```

        The thing's `attributes` may be modified without having to pass the `policyId` or
        the `features` in again.
        For updating the `attributes`, following request body would be sufficient :

        ```
        {
          "attributes": {
            "foo": 2,
            "bar": false
          }
        }
        ```

        The `policyId` and `features` of the thing will not be overwritten.
        The thing will be merged into:

        ```
        {
          "thingId": "namespace:thing-name",
          "policyId": "namespace:policy-name",
          "definition": "namespace:model:version",
          "attributes": {
            "foo": 2,
            "bar": false
          },
          "features": {...}
        }
        ```

        ### Create
        If the thing does not have a `policyId` yet, it is
        considered to have been created via API version 1, where the access control list `acl`
        mechanism is used. In that case, this request will create the `policyId`.

        Note: You will need to create the policy content separately.

        ### Update
        If the thing already has a `policyId` you can assign it to an existing policy by setting
        the new `policyId` in the request body.

        Create or modify all features of a thing identified by the `thingId`
        path parameter.
        ### Create all features at once
        In case at the initial creation of your thing you have not specified any features, these can be created here.

        ### Update all features at once
        To update all features at once prepare the JSON body accordingly.

        Note: In contrast to the "PUT thing" request, a partial update is not supported here,
        but the content will be **overwritten**.
        If you need to update single features or their paths, please use the sub-resources instead.

        Example:

        ```
        {
             "coffee-brewer": {
               "definition": ["com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"],

  '/things/{thingId}/inbox/claim':
    post:
      summary: Initiates claiming a specific thing in order to gain access
      description: |-
        ### Why
        A claiming process may enable an end-user to claim things and proof ownership thereof.
        Such a process is initially triggered via a claim message.
        This message can be sent to the things service with the HTTP API or the things-client.

        ### How
        At this resource you can send a "claim" message to the thing identified
        by the `thingId` path parameter in order to gain access to it. The "claim" message is forwarded
        together with the request body and `Content-Type` header to client(s)
        which registered for Claim messages of the specific thing.

        The decision whether to grant access (by setting permissions) is
        completely up to the client(s) which handle the "claim" message.

        The HTTP request blocks until a response to the issued "claim" message is
        available or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
        will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

        ### Who
        No special permission is required to issue a claim message.

        ### Example
        See [Claiming](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-specification-things-messages.html#sending-and-handling-claim-messages) concept in detail and example in GitHub.
        However, in that scenario, the policy should grant you READ and WRITE permission on
        the "message:/" resource in order to be able to send the message and read the response.
        Further, the things-client which handles the "claim" message, needs permission to change the policy itself
        (i.e. READ and WRITE permission on the "policy:/" resource).

      summary: Send a message TO a specific thing
      description: |-
        ### Why
        A message can be sent to a thing or one of its features in order to invoke an operation on the device.

        ### How
        Send a message with a `messageSubject` **to** the thing
        identified by the `thingId` path parameter. The request body contains
        the message payload and the `Content-Type` header defines its type.

        The API does not provide any kind of acknowledgement that the thing has received the message.

        The HTTP request blocks until a response to the message is available
        or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
        a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
        will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

        ### Who
        You will need `WRITE` permission on the root "message:/" resource, or at least
        the resource `message:/inbox/messages/messageSubject`. The receiving device needs `READ` permission on the resource.
        Such permission is managed within the policy which controls the access on the thing.

        ### Example
        Given you have a "coffemaker" thing as shown in the examples for the `things` resources.
        The `messageSubject` understood by such a device would be "makeCoffee".

        Further, as in our example the "brewed-coffees" counter would increase as a response, you would need `WRITE`
        permission for the things resource, at least at the respective path

        In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
        a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

        Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto

      summary: Create or update a policy with a specified ID
      description: |-
        Create or update the policy specified by the policyId path parameter.
        * If you set a new policyId in the path, a new policy will be created.
        * If you set an existing policyId in the path, the policy will be updated.

        ### Create a new policy
        At the initial creation of a policy, at least one valid entry is required. However, you can create a full-fledged policy all at once.

        Example: To create a policy for multiple coffee maker things,
        which gives **yourself** all permissions on all resources, set the policyId in the path,
        e.g. to "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" and the body part, like in the following snippet.

        ```
        {
          "entries": {
            "DEFAULT": {
              "subjects": {
                "{{ request:subjectId }}": {
                  "type": "the creator"
                }
              },
              "resources": {
                "policy:/": {
                  "grant": [
                    "READ",
                    "WRITE"
                  ],
                  "revoke": []
                },
                "thing:/": {
                  "grant": [
                    "READ",
                    "WRITE"
                  ],
                  "revoke": []
                },
                "message:/": {
                  "grant": [
                    "READ",
                    "WRITE"
                  ],
                  "revoke": []
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Update an existing policy
        For updating an existing policy, the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the policy's root resource.

        The ID of a policy cannot be changed after creation. Any `policyId` specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

        ### Partially update an existing policy
        Partial updates are not supported.

        If you need to create or update a specific label, resource, or subject, please use the respective sub-resources.

          Use the placeholder `{{ request:subjectId }}` in order to let the
          backend insert the authenticated subjectId of the HTTP request.

          ### Example
          Given your policy "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" only has the
          DEFAULT entry, and you want to add a "Consumer" section which additionally allows USER-01
          (managed within a Nginx reverse proxy) to
          *read* the thing and to trigger a "makeCoffee" operation (i.e. POST such a message - see
          POST /things/{thingId}/inbox/messages/{messageSubject}).

          Set the label value to **Consumer** and the following request body:
          ```
          {
             "subjects": {
               "nginx:USER-01": {
                 "type": "pre authenticated user from nginx"

             "resources": {
               "thing:/": {
                 "grant": [
                   "READ"
                 ],
                 "revoke": []
               },
               "message:/": {
                 "grant": [
                   "WRITE"

      summary: Search for things
      description: |-
        This resource can be used to search for things.

        * The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set, the
          result contains all things which the logged in user is allowed to read.

        * The search is case sensitive. In case you don't know how exactly the
          spelling of the namespace, name, attribute, feature etc. is, use the *like*
          notation for filtering

        * The resource supports sorting and paging. If paging is not explicitly
          specified by means of the `size` option, a default count of `25`
          documents is returned.

        * The internal search index is "eventually consistent".  Consistency with the latest
          thing updates should recover within milliseconds.

      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/searchFilter'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/namespacesFilter'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/thingFieldsQueryParam'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/timeoutParam'
        - name: option
          in: query
          description: |-
            Possible values for the parameter:

            #### Sort operations

            * ```sort([+|-]{property})```
            * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```

            #### Paging operations

            * ```size({page-size})```  Maximum allowed page size is `200`. Default page size is `25`.
            * ```cursor({cursor-id})```  Start the search from the cursor location. Specify the cursor ID without
            quotation marks. Cursor IDs are given in search responses and mark the position after the last entry of
            the previous search. The meaning of cursor IDs is unspecified and may change without notice.

            The paging option `limit({offset},{count})` is deprecated.
            It may result in slow queries or timeouts and will be removed eventually.

            #### Examples:

            * ```sort(+thingId)```
            * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```size(10)``` return 10 results
            * ```cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```  return results after the position of the cursor `LOREMIPSUM`.

            #### Combine:

            If you need to specify multiple options, when using the swagger UI just write each option in a new line.
            When using the plain REST API programmatically,
            you will need to separate the options using a comma (,) character.

            ```size(200),cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```

            The deprecated paging option `limit` may not be combined with the other paging options `size` and `cursor`.

            reference to a thing in the format `{{ ref:things/[thingId]/policyId }}` where you need to replace `[thingId]`
            with a valid thing ID. The newly created thing will then obtain a copy of the policy of the referenced thing.
            In the case of using a reference, the caller needs to have READ access to both the thing and the policy of the thing.
            In the case of using an explicit policy id to copy from, the caller needs to have READ access to the policy.
            If you want to specify a policy ID for the copied policy, use the policyId field.
            This field must not be used together with the field `_policy`. If you specify both `_policy` and

        Contains a comma-separated list of fields to be included in the returned
        JSON. attributes can be selected in the same manner.

        #### Selectable fields

        * `thingId`
        * `policyId`
        * `definition`
        * `attributes`

           Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields by using a comma-separated list:
            * several attribute paths can be passed as a comma-separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

              For example:
                * `?fields=attributes/model` would select only `model` attribute value (if present)
                * `?fields=attributes/model,attributes/location` would select only `model` and
                   `location` attribute values (if present)

          Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields inside parentheses `( )`:
            * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901)
              separated with `/`) to select

            * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions
              in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

              For example:
               * `?fields=attributes(model,location)` would select only `model`
                  and `location` attribute values (if present)
               * `?fields=attributes(coffeemaker/serialno)` would select the `serialno` value
                  inside the `coffeemaker` object
               * `?fields=attributes/address/postal(city,street)` would select the `city` and
                  `street` values inside the `postal` object inside the `address` object

        * `features`

          Supports selecting arbitrary fields in features similar to `attributes` (see also features documentation for more details)

        * `_namespace`

          Specifically selects the namespace also contained in the `thingId`

        * `_revision`

          Specifically selects the revision of the thing. The revision is a counter, which is incremented on each modification of a thing.

        * `_created`

          Specifically selects the created timestamp of the thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on creation of a thing.

        * `_modified`

          Specifically selects the modified timestamp of the thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on each modification of a thing.

        * `_metadata`

          Specifically selects the Metadata of the thing. The content is a JSON object having the Thing's JSON structure with the difference that the JSON leaves of the Thing are JSON objects containing the metadata.

        * `_policy`

          Specifically selects the content of the policy associated to the thing. (By default, only the policyId is returned.)

        #### Examples

        * `?fields=thingId,attributes,features`
        * `?fields=attributes(model,manufacturer),features`

          * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

            For example:
             * `?fields=location(longitude,latitude)` would select the `longitude` and `latitude` value inside the `location` attribute

        #### Examples

        * `?fields=model,make,location(longitude,latitude)`

        * `?fields=listOfAddresses/postal(city,street))`

        * ```exists({property})```  (i.e. all things in which the given path exists)


        Note: When using filter operations, only things with the specified properties are returned.
        For example, the filter `ne(attributes/owner, "SID123")` will only return things that do have
        the `owner` attribute.

        * ```and({query},{query},...)```

        * ```or({query},{query},...)```

        * ```not({query})```


        #### Examples:

        * ```eq(attributes/location,"kitchen")```

        * ```ge(thingId,"myThing1")```

        * ```gt(_created,"2020-08-05T12:17")```

        JSON string of the definition to be modified. Consider that the

        JSON object of all attributes to be modified at once. Consider that the

        Examples:
         * an empty object: `{}` - would just delete all old attributes
         * a simple object: `{ "key": "value"}` - We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters for the key (identifier), as the key might be needed for the (URL) path later.<br> Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9\-]*
         * a nested object as shown in the example value

        JSON representation of the value to be created/updated. This may be as
        well `null` or an empty object.

        Consider that the value has to be a JSON value, examples:

          * for a number, the JSON value is the number: `42`

          * for a string, the JSON value must be quoted: `"aString"`

          * for a boolean, the JSON value is the boolean: `true`

          * for an object, the JSON value is the object: `{ "key": "value"}` -} We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters for the key (identifier). Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9\-]*

          * for an list, the JSON value is the list: `[ 1,2,3 ]`
