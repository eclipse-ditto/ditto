  summary: Search for things
  description: |-
    This resource can be used to search for things.

    * The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set, the
      result contains all things which the logged in user is allowed to read.

    * The search is case sensitive. In case you don't know how exactly the
      spelling of value of the namespace, name, attribute, feature etc. is, use the *like*
      notation instead of *eq* for filtering.

    * The resource supports sorting and paging. If paging is not explicitly
      specified by means of the `size` option, a default count of `25`
      documents is returned.

    * The internal search index is "eventually consistent".  Consistency with the latest
      thing updates should recover within milliseconds.
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../../parameters/searchFilter.yml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/namespacesFilter.yml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/thingFieldsQueryParam.yml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/timeoutParam.yml'
    - name: option
      in: query
      description: |-
        Possible values for the parameter:

        #### Sort operations

        * ```sort([+|-]{property})```
        * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```

        #### Paging operations

        * ```size({page-size})```  Maximum allowed page size is `200`. Default page size is `25`.
        * ```cursor({cursor-id})```  Start the search from the cursor location. Specify the cursor ID without
        quotation marks. Cursor IDs are given in search responses and mark the position after the last entry of
        the previous search. The meaning of cursor IDs is unspecified and may change without notice.

        The paging option `limit({offset},{count})` is deprecated.
        It may result in slow queries or timeouts and will be removed eventually.

        #### Examples:

        * ```sort(+thingId)```
        * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```
        * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```
        * ```size(10)``` return 10 results
        * ```cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```  return results after the position of the cursor `LOREMIPSUM`.

        #### Combine:

        If you need to specify multiple options, when using the swagger UI just write each option in a new line.
        When using the plain REST API programmatically,
        you will need to separate the options using a comma (,) character.

        ```size(200),cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```

        The deprecated paging option `limit` may not be combined with the other paging options `size` and `cursor`.
