  summary: Count things
  description: |-
    This resource can be used to count things.

    The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set there is returned the total amount of things 
    which the logged in user is allowed to read.

    To search for nested properties, we use JSON Pointer notation (RFC-6901). See the following example how to search
    for the sub property `location` of the parent property `attributes` with a forward slash as separator:

    ```eq(attributes/location,"kitchen")```
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../../parameters/searchFilter.yml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/namespacesFilter.yml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/timeoutParam.yml'
