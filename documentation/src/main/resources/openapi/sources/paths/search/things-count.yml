  summary: Count things
  description: |-
    This resource can be used to count things.

    The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set there is
    returned the total amount of things which the logged in user is allowed
    to read.

    To search for nested properties, we use JSON Pointer notation
    (RFC-6901). See the following example how to search for the sub property
    `location` of the parent property `attributes` with a forward slash as
    separator:

    ```eq(attributes/location,"kitchen")```
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../../parameters/searchFilter.yml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/namespacesFilter.yml'
    - $ref: '../../parameters/timeoutParam.yml'
  tags:
    - Things-Search
