  summary: Retrieve visible things or things with specified IDs
  description: |-
    Returns all visible things or things passed in by the required parameter `ids`, which you (the authorized subject) are allowed to read.

    Optionally, if you want to retrieve only some of the thing's fields, you can use the specific field selectors (see parameter `fields`) .

    Tip: In order to formulate a `filter` which things to search for, take a look at the `/search` resource.

        The successfully completed request contains a list of the for the user available Things, or the Things asked for via the `ids` paramter.
        The Things are sorted either by their ID, or in the same order as the Thing IDs were provided in the `ids` parameter.

post:
  summary: Create a new thing
  description: |-
    Creates a thing with a default `thingId` and a default `policyId`.

    The thing will be empty, i.e. no features, definition, attributes etc. by default.

    The default `thingId` consists of your default namespace and a UUID.

    The default `policyId` is identical with the default `thingId`, and allows the currently authorized subject all permissions.

    In case you need to create a thing with a specific ID, use a *PUT* request instead, as any `thingId` specified in the request body will be ignored.

    The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can
    be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.
