  summary: Create or update the policy ID of a thing
  description: |-
    Create or update the policy ID of the thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

    ### Create
    If the thing does not have a `policyId` yet, it is considered to have been created via API version 1,
    where the access control list `acl` mechanism is used. In that case, this request will create the `policyId`.

    Note: You will need to create the policy content separately.

    ### Update
    If the thing already has a `policyId` you can assign it to an existing policy by setting the new `policyId`
    in the request body.
