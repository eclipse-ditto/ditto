  summary: Retrieve a specific attribute of a specific thing
  description: |-
    Returns a specific attribute of the thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

    The attribute (JSON) can be referenced hierarchically, by applying JSON Pointer notation (RFC-6901).

    ### Example:

    In order to retrieve the `name` field of an `manufacturer` attribute, the full path would be
    `/things/{thingId}/attributes/manufacturer/name`
  tags:
    - Things
  parameters:
