patch:
  summary: Patch all attributes of a specific thing
  description: |-
    Patch the attributes of a thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.
    The existing attributes will be merged with the JSON content set in the request body.

    Notice that the `null` value has a special meaning and can be used to delete all or specific attributes from a thing.
    For further documentation see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

    **Note**: In contrast to the "PUT things/{thingId}/attributes" request,
    a partial update is supported here and request body is merged with the existing attributes.

      JSON object of all attributes to be patched. Consider that the value has to be a [JSON merge patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

      Examples:
        * a simple object: `{ "key": "value"}` - We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters for the key (identifier), as the key might be needed for the (URL) path later.<br> Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9\-]*
        * a nested object as shown in the example value
        * `null`: deletes all attributes
