  summary: Create a new connection
  description: |-
    Creates the connection defined in the JSON body.
    The ID of the connection will be **generated** by the backend. Any `ID` specified in the request body is therefore
    prohibited.
    Supported connection types are `amqp-091`, `amqp-10`, `mqtt`, `mqtt-5`, `kafka`, `hono` and `http-push`.

        When set to true, the request will not try to create the connection, but only try to connect it.
        You can use this parameter to verify that the given connection is able to communicate with your external
        system.

        * an `ID` was set in the request body, but the ID will be generated by Ditto
