  summary: Send a message TO a specific thing
  description: |-
    ### Why
    A message can be sent to a thing or one of its features in order to invoke an operation on the device.

    ### How
    Send a message with a `messageSubject` **to** the thing
    identified by the `thingId` path parameter. The request body contains
    the message payload and the `Content-Type` header defines its type.

    The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.
    By default, it blocks until a response to the message is available
    or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
    the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

    In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
    a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

    Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
    will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
    will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

    ### Who
    You will need `WRITE` permission on the root "message:/" resource, or at least
    the resource `message:/inbox/messages/messageSubject`. The receiving device needs `READ` permission on the resource.
    Such permission is managed within the policy which controls the access on the thing.

    ### Example
    Given you have a "coffemaker" thing as shown in the examples for the `things` resources.
    The `messageSubject` understood by such a device would be "makeCoffee".

    Further, as in our example the "brewed-coffees" counter would increase as a response, you would need `WRITE`
    permission for the things resource, at least at the respective path

    `/things/{thingId}/features/coffee-brewer/properties/brewed-coffees`

        The request could not be completed. Possible reasons:
          * the `thingId` does not conform to the namespaced entity ID notation (see [Ditto documentation on namespaced entity IDs](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-namespaces-and-names.html#namespaced-id)).
          * at least one of the defined path parameters is invalid

        The request could not be completed. Possible reasons:
          * the caller has insufficient permissions.
            You need `WRITE` permission on the resource `message:/inbox/messages/{messageSubject}`.
