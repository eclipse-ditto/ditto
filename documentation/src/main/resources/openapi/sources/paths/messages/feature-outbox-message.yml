  summary: Send a message FROM a specific feature of a specific thing
  description: |-
    Send a message with the subject `messageSubject` **from** the feature
    specified by the `featureId` and `thingId` path parameter. The request
    body contains the message payload and the `Content-Type` header defines
    its type.

    The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.
    By default, it blocks until a response to the message is available
    or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
    the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

    In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
    a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

    Note that the client chooses which HTTP status code it wants to return. Ditto
    will forward the status code to you. (Also note that '204 - No Content' status code
    will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).

    ### Who
    You will need `WRITE` permission on the root "message:/" resource, or at least
    the resource `message:/features/featureId/outbox/messages/messageSubject`.
    Such permission is managed  within the policy which controls the access on the thing.

        The request could not be completed. Possible reasons:
          * the `thingId` does not conform to the namespaced entity ID notation (see [Ditto documentation on namespaced entity IDs](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-namespaces-and-names.html#namespaced-id)).
          * at least one of the defined path parameters is valid.
