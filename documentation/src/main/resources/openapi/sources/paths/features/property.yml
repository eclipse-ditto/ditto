  summary: Retrieve a specific property of a feature
  description: |-
    Returns the a specific property path of the feature identified by the `thingId` and `featureId` path parameter.

    The property (JSON) can be referenced hierarchically, by applying JSON Pointer notation (RFC-6901)

    ### Example
    To retrieve the value of the `brewingTemp` in the `water-tank` of our coffeemaker example the full path is:
    `/things/{thingId}/features/water-tank/properties/configuration/brewingTemp`

  summary: Patch a specific property of a feature
  description: |-
    Patch a specific property of a feature identified by the `thingId` and `featureId` path parameter.

    The existing property will be merged with the existing one of the thing.

    Notice that the `null` value can be used to delete the specified propertyPath.
    For further documentation see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).

    The property (JSON) can be referenced hierarchically, by applying JSON Pointer notation (RFC-6901).
