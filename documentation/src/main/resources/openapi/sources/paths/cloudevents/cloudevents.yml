  summary: Processes a CloudEvent sent in Ditto Protocol
  description: |-
    Provides an endpoint accepting [CloudEvents via its HTTP protocol binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/http-protocol-binding.md)
    in [Ditto Protocol JSON](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-specification.html).

    The endpoint can also directly be configured as a [Knative eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/) destination.

    Find more documentation on that [here](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-protocol-bindings-cloudevents.html).
