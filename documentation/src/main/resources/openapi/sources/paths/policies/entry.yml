      JSON representation of the policy entry.
      Use the placeholder `{{ request:subjectId }}` in order to let the
      backend insert the authenticated subjectId of the HTTP request.
      ### Example
      Given your policy "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" only has the
      DEFAULT entry, and you want to add a "Consumer" section which additionally allows USER-01
      (managed within a Nginx reverse proxy) to
      *read* the thing and to trigger a "makeCoffee" operation (i.e. POST such a message - see
      POST /things/{thingId}/inbox/messages/{messageSubject}).
      Set the label value to **Consumer** and the following request body:
      ```
      {
        "subjects": {
          "nginx:USER-01": {
            "type": "pre authenticated user from nginx"
          }
        },
        "resources": {
          "thing:/": {
            "grant": [
              "READ"
            ],
            "revoke": []
          },
          "message:/": {
            "grant": [
              "WRITE"
            ],
            "revoke": []
          }
        }
      }
      ```
