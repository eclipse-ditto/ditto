  summary: Retrieve the allowed import additions for a specific policy entry
  description: |-
    Returns the allowed import additions of the policy entry identified by the
    `policyId` path parameter and the `label` path parameter.

    Allowed import additions control which types of additions (subjects, resources) are permitted
    when this entry is imported by other policies via `entriesAdditions`.
