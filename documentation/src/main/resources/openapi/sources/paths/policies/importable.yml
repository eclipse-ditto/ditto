  summary: Retrieve the importable type for a specific policy entry
  description: |-
    Returns the importable type of the policy entry identified by the
    `policyId` path parameter and the `label` path parameter.

    The importable type controls whether and how a policy entry can be imported by other policies:
    * `implicit` (default): the entry is imported without being listed individually
    * `explicit`: the entry is only imported if it is listed in the importing policy
    * `never`: the entry is not imported, regardless of being listed
