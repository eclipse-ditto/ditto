        The request could not be completed. Possible reasons:
        * the caller has insufficient permissions.
          You need `WRITE` permission on the `policy:/imports` resource,
          without any revoke in a deeper path of the policy resource.
        * the caller has insufficient permissions.
          You need `READ` permission on the policy entries of the imported policies.
