  summary: Retrieve a specific entry addition of a policy import
  description: |-
    Returns the entry addition for the specified label of the policy import identified by the
    `policyId` path parameter and the `importedPolicyId` path parameter.

    An entry addition defines additional subjects and/or resources to be additively merged
    into the imported policy entry identified by the label.

    Create or modify the entry addition for the specified label of the policy import identified

    * If the entry addition does not yet exist, it will be created.
    * If the entry addition already exists, it will be updated.

    The imported policy entry must explicitly allow these additions via its "allowedImportAdditions"
    field, otherwise the additions are rejected.
