  summary: Retrieve a specific policy
  description: |-
    Returns the complete policy identified by the `policyId` path parameter. The
    response contains the policy as JSON object.

    Tip: If you don't know the policy ID of a thing, request it via GET `/things/{thingId}`.

    Optionally, you can use the field selectors (see parameter `fields`) to only get specific fields,
    which you are interested in.

    ### Example:
    Use the field selector `_revision` to retrieve the revision of the policy.

  summary: Create or update a policy with a specified ID
  description: |-
    Create or update the policy specified by the policyId path parameter.
    * If you set a new policyId in the path, a new policy will be created.
    * If you set an existing policyId in the path, the policy will be updated.

    ### Create a new policy
    At the initial creation of a policy, at least one valid entry is required. However, you can create a full-fledged policy all at once.

    By default the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the root resource of the created policy. You can
    however omit this check by setting the parameter `allow-policy-lockout` to `true`.

    Example: To create a policy for multiple coffee maker things,
    which gives **yourself** all permissions on all resources, set the policyId in the path,
    e.g. to "com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01" and the body part, like in the following snippet.

    ```
    {
      "entries": {
        "DEFAULT": {
          "subjects": {
            "{{ request:subjectId }}": {
              "type": "the creator"
            }
          },
          "resources": {
            "policy:/": {
              "grant": [
                "READ",
                "WRITE"
              ],
              "revoke": []
            },
            "thing:/": {
              "grant": [
                "READ",
                "WRITE"
              ],
              "revoke": []
            },
            "message:/": {
              "grant": [
                "READ",
                "WRITE"
              ],
              "revoke": []
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "imports": {
        "com.acme:importedPolicy" : {
          "entries": [ "IMPORTED" ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Update an existing policy
    For updating an existing policy, the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the policy's root resource.

    The ID of a policy cannot be changed after creation. Any `policyId` specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

    ### Partially update an existing policy
    Partial updates are not supported.

    If you need to create or update a specific label, resource, or subject, please use the respective sub-resources.

    Note: Delete the respective things **before** deleting the

    If you accidentally run into such a scenario, re-create the policy via
    PUT `/policies/{policyId}`.
