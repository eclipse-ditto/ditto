  summary: Retrieve the entries of a specific policy import
  description: |-
    Returns the entries (imported labels) of the policy import identified by the `policyId` path
    parameter and the `importedPolicyId` path parameter.

    The entries define which policy entries from the imported policy should be imported,
    identified by their labels. An empty array means all implicit entries are imported.
