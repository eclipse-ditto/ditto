  #### Filter predicates:

  * ```eq({property},{value})```  (i.e. equal to the given value)

  * ```ne({property},{value})```  (i.e. not equal to the given value)

  * ```gt({property},{value})```  (i.e. greater than the given value)

  * ```ge({property},{value})```  (i.e. equal to the given value or greater than it)

  * ```lt({property},{value})```  (i.e. lower than the given value or equal to it)

  * ```le({property},{value})```  (i.e. lower than the given value)

  * ```in({property},{value},{value},...)```  (i.e. contains at least one of the values listed)

  * ```like({property},{value})```  (i.e. contains values similar to the expressions listed)

  * ```ilike({property},{value})```  (i.e. contains values similar and case insensitive to the expressions listed)

  * ```exists({property})```  (i.e. all things in which the given path exists)


  Note: When using filter operations, only things with the specified properties are returned.
  For example, the filter `ne(attributes/owner, "SID123")` will only return things that do have
  the `owner` attribute.


  #### Logical operations:


  * ```and({query},{query},...)```

  * ```or({query},{query},...)```

  * ```not({query})```


  #### Examples:

  * ```eq(attributes/location,"kitchen")```

  * ```ge(thingId,"myThing1")```

  * ```gt(_created,"2020-08-05T12:17")```

  * ```exists(features/featureId)```

  * ```and(eq(attributes/location,"kitchen"),eq(attributes/color,"red"))```

  * ```or(eq(attributes/location,"kitchen"),eq(attributes/location,"living-room"))```

  * ```like(attributes/key1,"known-chars-at-start*")```

  * ```like(attributes/key1,"*known-chars-at-end")```

  * ```like(attributes/key1,"*known-chars-in-between*")```

  * ```like(attributes/key1,"just-som?-char?-unkn?wn")```

  The `like` filters with the wildcard `*` at the beginning can slow down your search request.
