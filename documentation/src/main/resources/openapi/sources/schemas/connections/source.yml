    uniqueItems: true
    items:
      type: string
      title: Authorization Subject
      description: |-
        An authorization subject associated with this source.
        You can either use a fixed subject or use a placeholder that resolves header values from incoming messages.
        For example to use the `device_id` header in the subject, you can specify the placeholder
        `{{ header:device_id }}` which is then replaced by Ditto when a message from this source is processed.
        By using a placeholder you can access any header value: `{{ header:<any-header-name> }}`
      example:
        - "ditto:myAuthorizationSubject"
        - "device:{{ header:device_id }}"
  enforcement:

      input:
        type: string
        title: Input value of enforcement
        description: |-
          The input value of the enforcement that should identify the origin of the message (e.g. a
          device id). You can use placeholders within this field depending on the connection type. E.g. for AMQP
          1.0 connections you can use `{{ header:[any-header-name] }}` to resolve the value from a message header.
        example: "{{ header:device_id }}"
      filters:
        type: array
        title: The enforcement filters
        description: An array of filters. One of the defined filters must match the input value from the message

          title: Enforcement filter
          description: |-
            A filter that must match the input value for a message to be accepted. You can use the placeholders
             `{{ thing:id }}`, `{{ thing:name }}` or `{{ thing:namespace }}` in a filter.
          example:
            - "{{ thing:id }}"

        description: |-
          The target address where responses of incoming commands from the parent source are published to.
          The following placeholders are allowed within the target address:

          * Thing ID: `{{ thing:id }}`

          * Thing Namespace: `{{ thing:namespace }}`

          * Thing Name: `{{ thing:name }}` (the part of the ID without the namespace)

          * Ditto protocol header value: `{{ header:[any-header-name] }}`

          If placeholder resolution fails for a response, then the response is dropped.
          NOTE Use "command" alias for connections of type "hono".
