  The configuration of a local SSH port forwarding used to tunnel the connection to the actual endpoint.
required:
  - enabled
  - uri
  - credentials
properties:
  enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether the tunnel is enabled
    example: true
  uri:
    type: string
    description: The URI of the SSH host in the format `ssh://[host]:[port]`.
    example: ssh://some.host:2222
  credentials:
    type: object
    description: |- 
      The credentials used to authenticate at the SSH host. Password and public key authentication are supported.
    required:
      - type
      - username
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        description: The type of credentials used to authenticate. Either `password` or `public-key`.
        enum:
          - password
          - public-key
        example: password
      username:
        type: string
        description: The username used for the authentication.
        example: user42
      password:
        type: string
        description: The password used for authentication when credentials type `password` is used.
        example: secret!
      publicKey:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Public key in PEM base64-encoded format using X.509 syntax. This field is required for credentials type
          `public-key`.
        example: "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
      privateKey:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Private key in PEM base64-encoded format using PKCS #8 syntax. This field is required for credentials type

  validateHost:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether the SSH host is validated using the provided fingerprints.
    example: true
  knownHosts:
    type: array
    description: |-
      A list of accepted public key fingerprints. One of these fingerprints must match the fingerprint 
      of the public key the SSH host provides.
    example: [ "MD5:e0:3a:34:1c:68:ed:c6:bc:7c:ca:a8:67:c7:45:2b:19" ]
    items: 
      type: string
      description: |-
        The fingerprint is in the format which the command line tool `ssh-keygen` produces,
        e.g. `MD5:e0:3a:34:1c:68:ed:c6:bc:7c:ca:a8:67:c7:45:2b:19`. The fingerprint is prefixed with the hash algorithm
        used to calculate the fingerprint. Supported algorithms are `MD5`, `SHA1`, `SHA224`, `SHA256`, `SHA384` and `SHA512`.
