  Additional subjects and/or resources to additively merge into imported policy entries.
  Each key is a label of an imported policy entry. The value is an object with optional "subjects"
  and/or "resources" fields that will be merged into the corresponding imported entry.
  Subjects are added (existing subjects from the template are preserved).
  For resources, new paths are added and overlapping paths get their permissions merged (union of
  grants and revokes; template revokes are always preserved).
  The imported policy entry must explicitly allow these additions via its "allowedImportAdditions"
  field, otherwise the additions are rejected.
