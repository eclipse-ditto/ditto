properties:
  beforeExpiry:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The duration before expiry when an announcement should be made.
      Must be a positive integer followed by one of `h` (hour), `m` (minute) or `s` (second).

    type: boolean
    description: Whether an announcement should be made when this subject is deleted.

    properties:
      labels:
        type: array
        description: Acknowledgement labels to request when an announcement is published.
        items:
          type: string
      timeout:
        type: string
        description: How long to wait for requested announcements before retrying publication of an announcement.
    example:
      labels: ["my-connection-id:my-issued-acknowledgement"]
      timeout: "5s"
  randomizationInterval:
    type: string
    minimum: "0ms"
    maximum: "999_999_999s"
    default: "5m"
    description: Interval in which the announcement can be sent earlier than the configured `beforeExpiry`. The actual point in time when the announcement will be sent is `beforeExpire` plus a randomly chosen time within the `randomizationInterval`. E.g assuming `beforeExpiry` is set to 5m and `randomizationInterval` is set to 1m, the announcements will be sent between 5 and 6 minutes before the subject expires. If omitted, the default value will be applied. If set to minimum, no randomization will be applied.
example:
  beforeExpiry: "5m"
  whenDeleted: true
  randomizationInterval: "5m"
