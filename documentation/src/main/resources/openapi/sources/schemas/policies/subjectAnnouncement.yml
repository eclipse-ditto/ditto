        items:
          type: string
      timeout:
        type: string
        description: How long to wait for requested announcements before retrying publication of an announcement.
    example:
      labels: ["my-connection-id:my-issued-acknowledgement"]
      timeout: "5s"
  randomizationInterval:
    type: string
    default: "5m"
    description: Interval in which the announcement can be sent earlier than the configured `beforeExpiry`. The actual point in time when the announcement will be sent is `beforeExpire` plus a randomly chosen time within the `randomizationInterval`. E.g assuming `beforeExpiry` is set to 5m and `randomizationInterval` is set to 1m, the announcements will be sent between 5 and 6 minutes before the subject expires. If omitted, the default value will be applied. If set to minimum, no randomization will be applied.
example:
  beforeExpiry: "5m"
  whenDeleted: true
  randomizationInterval: "5m"
