description: |-
    Similar to the `filter`, a `condition` may be passed to ensure strong consistency when querying things.
    
    This `condition` has the same syntax and semantics than the `filter` - it is however applied on the matched things
    selected by the `filter` - on their current state.
    
    So combining this together with `filter` can provide strong consistency when performing a search.
