description: |-
  JSON representation of the value to be patched. This may be as well an empty object.

  Consider that the value has to be a JSON value.

  Examples:
    * for a number, the JSON value is the number: `42`
    * for a string, the JSON value must be quoted: `"aString"`
    * for a boolean, the JSON value is the boolean: `true`
    * for an object, the JSON value is the object: `{ "key": "value"}` -} We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters for the key (identifier). Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9\-]*
    * for an list, the JSON value is the list: `[ 1,2,3 ]`
    * special value `null` will delete the referenced key. For further documentation see [RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).
