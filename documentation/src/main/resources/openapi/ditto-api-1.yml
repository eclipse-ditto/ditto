      summary: Create or update a Thing
      description: >-
        Create or update the Thing specified by the `thingId` path parameter and
        the optional JSON body. The `thingId` has to:

          * contain a mandatory namespace prefix (java package notation + `:` colon) - periods (`.`) may be used in namespace but not as first or last character
          * conform to RFC-2396 (URI)

        #### Valid examples

          * `org.eclipse.ditto.myproject:myFridge1`
          * `mynamespace:myFridge1`

        #### Invalid examples

          * `42:myFridge1`
          * `.foo:myFridge1`
          * `bar.:myFridge1`

        The ID of a Thing can't be changed after creation. Any `thingId`
        specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

        ### Creation of a new Thing

        The ACL of the created Thing must include at least one entry with `READ`, `WRITE` and `ADMINISTRATE` permissions set to `true`.
        If no ACL is provided, a default ACL with an entry for the authorized subject with all permissions set to `true` will be created.


        Use the placeholder `${request.subjectId}` in order to let the backend insert the authenticated subjectId of the HTTP request.

        ### Update of an existing Thing

        For updating an existing Thing the authorized subject has to have the `WRITE` permission.
        If the new Thing to update contains an `acl` entry, the authorized subject additionally has to have the `ADMINISTRATE` permission.
        For authorized subjects which don't have the `ADMINISTRATE` permission, the complete Thing may be updated if the `acl` entry is not set.

      description: >-
        Send a Claim message to the Thing identified by the `thingId` path
        parameter in order to gain access to it. The Claim message is forwarded
        together with the request body and `Content-Type` header to client(s)
        which registered for Claim messages of the specific Thing.


        The decision whether to grant access (by setting permissions) is
        completely up to the client(s) which handle the Claim message.


        The HTTP request blocks until a response to the issued Claim message is

      summary: Search for Things
      description: >-
        This resource can be used to search for things.

        The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set there
        are returned all things which the logged in user is allowed to read. The
        resource supports sorting and paging. If paging is not explicitly
        specified by means of the `limit` option, a default count of `25`
        documents is returned.

        To search for nested properties, we use JSON Pointer notation
        (RFC-6901). See the following example how to search for the sub property
        `location` of the parent property `attributes` with a forward slash as
        separator:



        ```eq(attributes/location,"kitchen")```



        There can also be searched for feature properties using the following
        syntax:



        ``eq(features/*/properties/temperature,38)``


        The '*' indicates that there is searched on all available features for a
        property named 'temperature'.



        Attention, at the moment we do not support search on array fields.


        The search result can be limited to the Things within a namespace (or namespaces)
        given in the `namespaces` parameter.

      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/parameters/searchFilter'
        - $ref: '#/parameters/namespacesFilter'
        - name: option
          in: query
          description: >-

            ##### Sort operations:


            * ```sort([+|-]{property})```

            * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```


            ##### Paging operations:


            * ```limit({offset},{count})```  default is ```limit(0,25)```,
            maximum allowed count is `200`


            Note: We recommend not to use high offsets (e. g., higher than 10,000) for paging because of potential
            performance degradations.


            ##### Examples:


            * ```sort(+thingId)```

            * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```

            * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```

            * ```limit(0,10)``` return the first ten results

            * ```limit(10,10)```  return the next ten results


            ##### Combining options:


             If you need to specify multiple options, when using the Swagger UI just write each option in a new line.
             When using the plain HTTP API programmatically, you will need to separate the options using a comma (,)
             character.

    name: fields
    in: query
    description: >-
      Contains a comma separated list of fields to be included in the returned
      JSON. Attributes can be selected in the same manner.

      #### Selectable fields

      * `thingId`

      * `acl`

      * `attributes`

        Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields by using a comma separated list:
          * several attribute paths can be passed as a comma separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

            For example:
              * `?fields=attributes/model` would select only `model` attribute value (if present)
              * `?fields=attributes/model,attributes/make` would select only `model` and `make` attribute values (if present)

        Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields inside parentheses `( )`:
          * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901) separated with `/`) to select
          * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

            For example:
             * `?fields=attributes(model,make)` would select only `model` and `make` attribute values (if present)
             * `?fields=attributes(location/longitude)` would select the `longitude` value inside the `location` object
             * `?fields=attributes/address/postal(city,street)` would select the `city` and `street` values inside the `postal` object inside the `address` object


      * `features`

        Supports selecting arbitrary fields in features similar to `attributes` (see also Features documentation for more details)

      * `_namespace`

        Specifically selects the namespace also contained in the `thingId`

      * `_revision`

        Specifically selects the revision of the Thing. The revision is a counter which is incremented on each modification of a Thing.

      * `_modified`

        Specifically selects the modified timestamp of the Thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on each modification of a Thing.

      #### Examples

      * `?fields=thingId,attributes,features`

      * `?fields=attributes(model,make),features`

      *
      `?fields=thingId,attributes/location/longitude,attributes/address(city,street)`

      #### Selectable fields

      Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields as defined in the attributes by
      using a comma separated list:
        * several properties paths can be passed as a comma separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

          For example:
            * `?fields=model` would select only `model` attribute value (if present)
            * `?fields=model,make` would select only `model` and `make` attribute values (if present)

      Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields
      inside parentheses `( )`:
        * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901) separated with `/`) to select
        * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

          For example:
           * `?fields=location(longitude,latitude)` would select the `longitude` and `latitude` value inside the `location` attribute

      #### Examples

      * `?fields=model,make,location(longitude,latitude)`

      * `?fields=listOfAddresses/postal(city,street))`

      #### Selectable fields

      Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields as defined in the properties by
      using a comma separated list:
        * several properties paths can be passed as a comma separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

            * `?fields=temperature` would select only `temperature` property value (if present)
            * `?fields=temperature,humidity` would select only `temperature` and `humidity` property values (if present)

      Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields
      inside parentheses `( )`:
