        The ID of the created Thing is a UUID generated by the service with the default namespace `org.eclipse.ditto`.
        Any `thingId`

        entry with `READ`, `WRITE` and `ADMINISTRATE` permissions set to `true`.
        If no ACL is provided, a default ACL with an entry for the authorized subject with all permissions set to

      summary: Create or update a Thing with a specified ID
      description: |-
        Create or update the Thing specified by the `thingId` path parameter and the optional JSON body. The `thingId` has to:

          * contain a mandatory namespace prefix (java package notation + `:` colon) - periods (`.`) may be used in namespace but not as first or last character
          * conform to RFC-2396 (URI)

        #### Valid examples

          * `org.eclipse.ditto.myproject:myFridge1`
          * `mynamespace:myFridge1`

        #### Invalid examples

          * `42:myFridge1`
          * `.foo:myFridge1`
          * `bar.:myFridge1`

        The ID of a Thing can't be changed after creation. Any `thingId` specified in the request body is therefore ignored.

        ### Creation of a new Thing

        The ACL of the created Thing must include at least one entry with `READ`, `WRITE` and `ADMINISTRATE` permissions set to `true`.
        If no ACL is provided, a default ACL with an entry for the authorized subject with all permissions set to `true` will be created.


        Use the placeholder `{{ request:subjectId }}` in order to let the backend insert the authenticated subjectId of the HTTP request.

        ### Permissions for updating an existing Thing

        For updating an existing Thing the authorized subject has to have the `WRITE` permission.
        If the new Thing to update contains an `acl` entry, the authorized subject additionally has to have the `ADMINISTRATE` permission.
        For authorized subjects which don't have the `ADMINISTRATE` permission, the complete Thing may be updated if the `acl` entry is not set.

        ### Partially updating an existing Thing

        When updating an existing Thing already containing `attributes`, `acl` or `features` the already existing fields
        must not explicitly be provided again. For this "PUT Thing" request (and only for this top-level update on the
        Thing) the top-level field to update is merged with the existing top-level fields of the Thing.


        For example: A Thing already exists with this content:

        ```

        {
          "thingId": "namespace:thing-name",
          "acl": {...},
          "attributes": {
            "foo": 1
          },
          "features": {...}
        }

        ```

        The Thing's `attributes` may be modified without having to pass the `acl` or the `features` in again. The content
        of the request's body would be sufficient for updating the `attributes`:

        ```

        {
          "attributes": {
            "foo": 2,
            "bar": false
          }
        }

        ```

        The `acl` and `features` of the Thing will not be overwritten, the Thing will be merged as one would expect it:

        ```

        {
          "thingId": "namespace:thing-name",
          "acl": {...},
          "attributes": {
            "foo": 2,
            "bar": false
          },
          "features": {...}
        }

        ```

      description: |-
        Send a message with the subject `messageSubject` `FROM` the Feature
        specified by the `featureId` and `thingId` path parameter. The request
        body contains the message payload and the `Content-Type` header defines
        its type. In order to send a message, the user needs `WRITE` permission
        at the Thing level.

        The HTTP request blocks until a response to the message is available
        or until the `timeout` is expired. If many clients respond to
        the issued message, the first response will complete the HTTP request.

        In order to handle the message in a fire and forget manner, add
        a query-parameter `timeout=0` to the request.

    get:
      summary: Search for Things
      description: |-
        This resource can be used to search for things.

        The query parameter `filter` is not mandatory. If it is not set there are returned all things which the logged
        in user is allowed to read. The resource supports sorting
        and paging. If paging is not explicitly specified by means of the `limit`
        option, a default count of `25` documents is returned.

        To search for nested properties, we use JSON Pointer notation (RFC-6901).
        See the following example how to search for the sub property `location`
        of the parent property `attributes` with a forward slash as separator:

        ```eq(attributes/location,"kitchen")```
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/searchFilter'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/namespacesFilter'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/thingFieldsQueryParam'
        - name: option
          in: query
          description: |-
            Possible values for the parameter:

            ###### Sort operations

            * ```sort([+|-]{property})```
            * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```

            ###### Paging operations

            * ```size({page-size})```  Maximum allowed page-size is `200`.
            * ```cursor({cursor-id})```  Start the search from the cursor location. Specify the cursor ID without
            quotation marks. Cursor IDs are given in responses and mark the position after the final search result.
            The meaning of cursor IDs is unspecified and may change without notice.

            The paging option `limit({offset},{count})` is deprecated.
            It may result in slow queries, time-outs and will be removed eventually.

            ##### Examples:

            * ```sort(+thingId)```
            * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```
            * ```size(10)``` return 10 results
            * ```cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```  return results after the position of the cursor `LOREMIPSUM`.

            ##### Combine:

            If you need to specify multiple options, when using the swagger UI just write each option in a new line.
            When using the plain REST API programmatically,
            you will need to separate the options using a comma (,) character.

            ```size(200),cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```

            The deprecated paging option `limit` may not combine with the other paging options `size` and `cursor`.

        Contains a comma separated list of fields to be included in the returned JSON. Attributes can be selected in the same manner.

        #### Selectable fields

        * `thingId`

        * `acl`

        * `attributes`

          Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields by using a comma separated list:
            * several attribute paths can be passed as a comma separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

              For example:
                * `?fields=attributes/model` would select only `model` attribute value (if present)
                * `?fields=attributes/model,attributes/make` would select only `model` and `make` attribute values (if present)

          Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields inside parentheses `( )`:
            * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901) separated with `/`) to select
            * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

              For example:
               * `?fields=attributes(model,make)` would select only `model` and `make` attribute values (if present)
               * `?fields=attributes(location/longitude)` would select the `longitude` value inside the `location` object
               * `?fields=attributes/address/postal(city,street)` would select the `city` and `street` values inside the `postal` object inside the `address` object


        * `features`

          Supports selecting arbitrary fields in features similar to `attributes` (see also Features documentation for more details)

        * `_namespace`

          Specifically selects the namespace also contained in the `thingId`

        * `_revision`

          Specifically selects the revision of the Thing. The revision is a counter which is incremented on each modification of a Thing.

        * `_modified`

          Specifically selects the modified timestamp of the Thing in ISO-8601 UTC format. The timestamp is set on each modification of a Thing.

        #### Examples

        * `?fields=thingId,attributes,features`

        * `?fields=attributes(model,make),features`

        * `?fields=thingId,attributes/location/longitude,attributes/address(city,street)`

        #### Selectable fields

        Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields as defined in the attributes by using a comma separated list:
          * several properties paths can be passed as a comma separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

            For example:
              * `?fields=model` would select only `model` attribute value (if present)
              * `?fields=model,make` would select only `model` and `make` attribute values (if present)

          * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

            For example:
             * `?fields=location(longitude,latitude)` would select the `longitude` and `latitude` value inside the `location` attribute

        #### Examples

        * `?fields=model,make,location(longitude,latitude)`

        * `?fields=listOfAddresses/postal(city,street))`

          * several properties paths can be passed as a comma separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

            For example:
              * `?fields=temperature` would select only `temperature` property value (if present)
              * `?fields=temperature,humidity` would select only `temperature` and `humidity` property values (if present)

        Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields inside parentheses `( )`:
