## Changes

### [Make it easy to add new Authentication mechanisms and allow chaining them](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/issues/348)

If we have multiple applicable authentication mechanisms all of them are processed until either one of them 
authenticates successfully or all of them fail.

### [Unify implementations of things-search across API versions](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/pull/392)

Ditto's "search" capabilities were rewritten so that bot API v1 and API v2 use the same MongoDB based search index.

{% include warning.html content="If you want to upgrade an existing Ditto installation, the following database 
        migration has to be done: **Follow the steps documented in [the migration notes](architecture-services-things-search.html#migration-from-ditto-090-m1)**." %}
