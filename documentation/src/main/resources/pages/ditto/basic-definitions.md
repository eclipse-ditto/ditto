Ditto supports contract-based development by using Definitions to ensure validity and integrity of your managed assets. This concept is especially useful for large-scale and cross-domain solutions.

These formal Definitions are derived from device abstractions - so called “Information Models” and “Function Blocks” - which can be modeled based on [Eclipse Vorto](http://www.eclipse.org/vorto/).
