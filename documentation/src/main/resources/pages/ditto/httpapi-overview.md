Ditto's HTTP API is documented separately in the [HTTP API Doc](http-api-doc.html).

There you can explore the two different API versions (the difference is described in [the Basic Overview](basic-overview.html)).

Ditto does not provide a fully compliant RESTful API in the [academic sense](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)
as it does not include hyperlinks in the HTTP responses.<br/>
It however tries to follow the other best practices.

If you have any feedback on how to improve at that point, Ditto's developer team is [eager to learn](support.html).

## Content Type

The currently only supported content-type is JSON.
