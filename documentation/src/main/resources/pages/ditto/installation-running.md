## Start Ditto

Resource requirements:
* in order to start Ditto locally (via Docker Compose), you'll need **at least**:
  * 2 CPU cores to be used by Docker
  * 4 GB of RAM to be used by Docker
* if you decide to run Ditto in a local Kubernetes environment, you'll need some additional resources for Kubernetes

In order to start Ditto, you'll need:
* a [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) service or container with version __4.2__ as backing datastore of Ditto.
  (if you want to use a managed MongoDB service have a look in the [section](#managed-mongodb-service) below)
   * Supported MongoDB versions:
     * 4.2
     * 4.4
     * 5.0
* the built Docker images of Ditto
    * either by building them as described in [Building Ditto](installation-building.html),
    * or by using the pre-built [Ditto images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/eclipse/).
* some other tools like docker-compose, helm, k3s, minikube or openshift to run Ditto.
 
You can choose from several options to run/deploy Ditto.
A good starting point here is [Ditto Deployment](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/deployment/README.md).
After completing the deployment of your choice Ditto should be up & running.

Now you have running:
* a MongoDB as backing datastore of Ditto (not part of Ditto but started to get Ditto running),
* Ditto microservices:
   * Policies,
   * Things,
   * Connectivity,  
   * Thing-Search,
   * Gateway
* an instance of nginx acting as a reverse proxy performing a simple "basic authentication" listening on a local port 
   * including some static HTTP + API documentation

The running port on which Ditto can be accessed is described in the Readme of the respective deployment section.

### Managed MongoDB service
When using a managed MongoDB service the following recommendations should be taken into account:
- at least a 3 Node dedicated cluster for high-traffic applications and large datasets
- Cluster scaling depending on load

Other Recommendations:
- SSL/TLS 1.2 and above
- Data Encryption at rest
- Daily Backups
