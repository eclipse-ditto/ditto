You can integrate your solutions with Ditto 

* via the [HTTP API](http-api-doc.html) or
* via WebSocket.

On all APIs Ditto protects functionality and data by using

* **Authentication** to make sure the requester is the one she claims to be,
* **Authorization** to make sure the requester is allowed to see, use or change the information he wants to access.

## Authentication

User authentication at the HTTP API

A user who calls the HTTP API can be authenticated using two mechanisms:

* Pre-authentication by an HTTP reverse proxy in front of Ditto, e.g. doing HTTP BASIC Authentication by providing 
  username and password as [documented in the installation/operation guide](installation-operating.html#pre-authentication).
* A <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.jwt}}">JWT</a> issued by Google or other
  OpenID Connect providers as [documented in the installation/operation guide](installation-operating.html#openid-connect).

## Authorization

Authorization is implemented with an <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.acl}}">ACL</a>
(in API version 1) or a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.policy}}">Policy</a>
(in API version 2).

Please find details at [ACL](basic-acl.html) and [Policies](basic-policy.html).

### Authorization Context in DevOps Commands

An `authorizationContext` which is passed to [DevOps Commands](installation-operating.html#devops-commands) needs
to be a subject known to Ditto's authentication. In the simplest case, it's `nginx:{username}` where `{username}` is a user 
that is configured for basic auth in the included nginx's `nginx.htpasswd` file (where the `nginx:` prefix comes from).

If you are using the provided docker quickstart example from [Getting Started](installation-running.html) you
can simply use `nginx:ditto`, then the commands that are passed from the connection are executed as if they 
were issued via HTTP from the user `ditto`.
