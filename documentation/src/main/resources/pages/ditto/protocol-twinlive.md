The Ditto Protocol furthermore covers two different communication channels to address different aspects of devices and 
their **digital twins**.

## Twin

The first *channel*, **twin**, connects to the digital representation of a Thing.
This Thing is managed with Ditto and its state and properties can be read and updated.

## Live

The second *channel*, **live**, routes a command/message towards an actual device.
The handling and execution of a received command/message by a device (or a gateway which connects the device) is very 
specific to the solution and thus out of Ditto's scope.

What Ditto however does, when routing **live** commands/messages, is an [authorization check](basic-auth.html).
Thus Ditto ensures that only authorized parties are able to send commands or messages.
