In order to manage (CRUD) connections in Ditto [DevOps commands](installation-operating.html#devops-commands)
have to be used. There is no separate HTTP API for managing the connections, as this is not a task for a developer using 
the digital twin APIs but more for a "DevOps engineer" creating new connections to external systems.

All connection related piggyback commands use the following HTTP endpoint:

```
POST /devops/piggyback/connectivity
```

## CRUD commands

The following commands are available in order to manage connections:


* [create](#create-connection)
* [modify](#modify-connection)
* [retrieve](#retrieve-connection)
* [delete](#delete-connection)

### Create connection

Create a new connection by sending the following DevOps command:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:createConnection",
        "connection": {}
    }
}
```

The content of the connection configuration object is specified in the [Connections section](basic-connections.html).
For protocol specific examples, consult the [AMQP-0.9.1 binding](connectivity-protocol-bindings-amqp091.html),
[AMQP-1.0 binding](connectivity-protocol-bindings-amqp10.html) or
[MQTT-3.1.1 binding](connectivity-protocol-bindings-mqtt.html) respectively.

### Modify connection

Modify an existing connection by sending the following DevOps command:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:modifyConnection",
        "connection": {}
    }
}
```

The connection with the specified ID needs to be created before one can modify it.


### Retrieve connection

The only parameter necessary for retrieving a connection is the `connectionId`:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:retrieveConnection",
        "connectionId":"<connectionID>"
    }
}
```

### Open connection

The only parameter necessary for opening a connection is the `connectionId`:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:openConnection",
        "connectionId":"<connectionID>"
    }
}
```

### Close connection

The only parameter necessary for closing a connection is the `connectionId`:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:closeConnection",
        "connectionId":"<connectionID>"
    }
}
```

### Delete connection

The only parameter necessary for deleting a connection is the `connectionId`:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:deleteConnection",
        "connectionId":"<connectionID>"
    }
}
```

## Helper commands

The following commands are available to help creating connections and retrieving the status of existing connections:

* [test](#test-connection)
* [retrieve connection status](#retrieve-connection-status)
* [retrieve connection metrics](#retrieve-connection-metrics)
* [reset connection metrics](#reset-connection-metrics)
* [enable connection logs](#enable-connection-logs)
* [retrieve connection logs](#retrieve-connection-logs)
* [reset connection logs](#reset-connection-logs)

### Test connection

Run a test connection command before creating a persisted connection to validate the connection configuration. This
command checks the configuration and establishes a connection to the remote endpoint in order to validate the connection
credentials. The test connection is closed afterwards and will not be persisted. Analog to the [createConnection](#create-connection)
command, it requires a full connection configuration in the piggyback command.

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:testConnection",
        "connection": {
           ... //Define connection configuration
        }
    }
}
```

### Retrieve connection status

This command returns the connection status by showing if a connection is currently enabled/disabled and if it is 
successfully established. The only parameter necessary for retrieving the connection status is the `connectionId`:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:retrieveConnectionStatus",
        "connectionId":"<connectionID>"
    }
}
```

### Retrieve connection metrics

This command returns the connection metrics showing how many messages have been successfully or failingly `conusmed`, 
`filtered`, `mapped`, `published`, `dropped`. The metrics are collected and returned in different time intervals:
* the last minute
* the last hour
* the last 24 hours 

The only parameter necessary for retrieving the connection metrics is the `connectionId`:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:retrieveConnectionMetrics",
        "connectionId":"<connectionID>"
    }
}
```

### Reset connection metrics

This command resets the connection metrics - all metrics are set to `0` again. The only parameter
necessary for retrieving the connection metrics is the `connectionId`:

```json
{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
      "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand": {
        "type": "connectivity.commands:resetConnectionMetrics",
        "connectionId":"<connectionID>"
    }
}
```

### Enable connection logs

Enables the connection logging feature of a connection for 24 hours.
As soon as connection logging is enabled, you will be able to [retrieve connection logs](#retrieve-connection-logs). The
logs will contain a fixed amount of success and failure logs for each source and target of your connection and correlate
with the metrics of the connection. This will allow you more insight in what goes well, and more importantly, what goes wrong.

The default duration and the maximum amount of logs stored for one connection can be configured in Ditto's connectivity service
configuration.

```json
{

    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
        "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand":{
		"type": "connectivity.commands:enableConnectionLogs",
		"connectionId": "<connectionID>"
	}
}
```

### Retrieve connection logs

This command will return a list of success and failure log entries containing information on messages processed by the
connection. The logs have a maximum amount of entries that they can hold. If the connection produces more log entries,
the older entries will be dropped. So keep in mind that you might miss some of the log entries.
 
The response will also provide information on how long the logging feature will still be enabled. Since the timer will
always be reset when retrieving the logs, the timestamp will always be 24 hours from now.

The default duration and the maximum amount of logs stored for one connection can be configured in Ditto's connectivity service
configuration.

```json
{

    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
        "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand":{
		"type": "connectivity.commands:retrieveConnectionLogs",
		"connectionId": "<connectionID>"
	}
}
```

### Reset connection logs

Clears all currently stored connection logs.

```json
{

    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",
    "headers": {
        "aggregate": false
    },
    "piggybackCommand":{
		"type": "connectivity.commands:resetConnectionLogs",
		"connectionId": "<connectionID>"
	}
}
```


## Payload mapping configuration

To enable a custom [payload mapping](connectivity-mapping.html) for a specific connection, you have to configure a
mapping context in the connection configuration object. The following snippet shows an example `mappingContext`. This
configuration must be embedded in the connection configuration as shown in the [Connections](basic-connections.html) section.

```json
"mappingContext": {
    "mappingEngine": "JavaScript",
    "options": {
      "incomingScript": "..",
      "outgoingScript": ".."
    }
  }
```
