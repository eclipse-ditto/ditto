## What is it?

Eclipse Ditto is a technology in the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.iot}}">IoT</a> 
implementing a software pattern called “**[Digital Twins](intro-digitaltwin.html)**”.<br/>
A Digital Twin is a virtual, cloud based, representation of his real world counterpart 
(real world “Things”, e.g. devices like sensors, smart heating, connected cars, smart grids, EV charging stations, …).

The technology mirrors potentially millions and billions of digital twins residing in the digital world with physical “**Things**”. 
This simplifies developing IoT solutions for software developers as they do not need to know how or where 
exactly the physical “Things” are connected.

With Ditto, “Things” can just be used as any other web service via their digital twins.


## What is it not?

Ditto is not another full fledged IoT platform. It does not provide software running on IoT gateways and it does not define
or implement an IoT protocol in order to communicate with devices.

Its focus is on backend scenarios by providing web APIs in order to simplify working with already connected (e.g. via 
[Eclipse Hono](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/)) devices and “Things” from customer apps or other backend software.

It also does not specify which data or which structure a “Thing” in the IoT has to provide. 


## When to use it?

{% include callout.html content="**TL;DR**<br/>Use it in order to get a full fledged, authorization aware, web API 
                                (HTTP and Websocket) in order to access your “Things” and their last reported state." type="primary" %}

Imagine you are building an IoT solution. And let's assume that you use both hardware (e.g. sensors or actuators) and
software (e.g. a mobile or web app) in order to solve your customer's problem.

In such a scenario you have several places where to implement software:
* on or near the hardware, e.g. on an Arduino using `C/C++` or on an Raspberry PI using `Python`
* optionally on a gateway establishing the Internet connectivity (e.g. based on [Eclipse Kura](https://www.eclipse.org/kura/))
* in the mobile or web app using `Java`, `Javascript`, `Swift`, etc.
* in the “backend” fulfilling several responsibilities
    * providing an API abstracting from the hardware
    * routing requests between hardware and customer apps
    * ensuring only authorized access
    * persisting last reported state of hardware as cache and for providing the data when hardware is currently not connected
    * notifying interested parties (e.g. other backend services) about changes
    * …

Ditto focuses on solving the responsibilities a typical “backend” has in such scenarios.

{% include callout.html content="Its goal is that IoT solutions do not need to implement and operate a custom backend, but that 
                                 by using Eclipse Ditto they can focus on business requirements, on connecting devices to the 
                                 cloud / backend and implementing business applications." type="info" %}
