We finally managed to build our first milestone of Eclipse Ditto: [0.1.0-M1](release_notes_010-M1.html)

Java artifacts were published to both the [Eclipse Maven repository](https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/ditto/)
as well as [Maven central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/ditto/).

Additionally Docker images were pushed to Docker Hub:
* [eclipse/ditto-policies](https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-policies/)
* [eclipse/ditto-things](https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-things/)
* [eclipse/ditto-things-search](https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-things-search/)
* [eclipse/ditto-gateway](https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-gateway/)

You can simply follow the instructions in [Running Ditto](installation-running.html) to try it out now.

We also have found our logo which you can now see on the landing page.
