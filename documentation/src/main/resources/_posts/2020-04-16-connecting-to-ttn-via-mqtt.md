<br/>

A workshop of the [2020 The Things Virtual Conference](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/article/the-things-virtual-conference)
on April 16th 2020 is/was about how to connect Eclipse Ditto to "The Things Network" via TTN's MQTT broker in order to 
automatically update digital twins of devices connected via LoRaWAN to the TTN backend.

You can find the slides [here](slides/2020_04_16-ttn-virtual-conference/index.html).

This blogpost helps setting up this kind of connection and shall also be used as a step-by-step tutorial during
 the workshop. 

## Requirements

You'll need:
* an operating system capable of running Docker (best use a Linux distribution)
* 4 CPU cores and 4GB of RAM are advised (less can work, but the Ditto cluster startup is more fragile then)
* to have installed: `curl` and `git`

Also, you'll need a TTN account and an existing application with at least one device if you want to follow the hands-on
part and want to create digital twins of your devices connected to TTN.

## Preparation

Please follow these initial preparation steps (if you don't already have Docker and Docker Compose installed).

When you have access to a Kubernetes cluster and already have worked with [Helm](https://helm.sh) (the package manager
for Kubernetes), you can alternatively install Ditto via its official 
[Helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/eclipse-iot/ditto).

### Install Docker

Assumption: You're running a Debian or Ubuntu based Linux distribution containing the `apt` package manager.

```shell
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker <your-username>
```

Logout and login again so that your user gets the "docker" group.

### Install Docker Compose

[Follow the installation guide here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), in short:

```shell
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Clone Ditto codebase

That is required to get the `docker-compose.yaml` file and other resources required to run Ditto with Docker Compose.

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/eclipse/ditto.git
```


## Startup Ditto cluster

Change directory into the just cloned git repository - optionally adjust the `DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT` variable to where 
Ditto is reachable after the start:

```shell
cd ditto/deployment/docker/
export DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT=80
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify that Ditto is running:

```shell
docker-compose ps
```

The output should look similar like this:
```
         Name                       Command               State           Ports         
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker_concierge_1       /sbin/tini -- java -jar st ...   Up      8080/tcp              
docker_connectivity_1    /sbin/tini -- java -jar st ...   Up      8080/tcp              
docker_gateway_1         /sbin/tini -- java -Dditto ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8081->8080/tcp
docker_mongodb_1         docker-entrypoint.sh mongo ...   Up      27017/tcp             
docker_nginx_1           nginx -g daemon off;             Up      0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp    
docker_policies_1        /sbin/tini -- java -jar st ...   Up      8080/tcp              
docker_swagger-ui_1      nginx -g daemon off;             Up      80/tcp, 8080/tcp      
docker_things-search_1   /sbin/tini -- java -jar st ...   Up      8080/tcp              
docker_things_1          /sbin/tini -- java -jar st ...   Up      8080/tcp
```

Verify that your Ditto cluster is healthy. Please give it ~1 minute in order to properly start up.

```shell
curl -u devops:foobar http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/status/health
```

The returned output should start with:
```json
{"label":"roles","status":"UP", ... }
```

If your Ditto cluster has trouble starting up (e.g. because you only have less CPU cores than advised), try the following
startup command instead:

```shell
docker-compose start mongodb; sleep 30; docker-compose start policies things; sleep 60; docker-compose start concierge; sleep 60; docker-compose start things-search; sleep 60; docker-compose start connectivity; sleep 60; docker-compose up -d
```


## Configure connection to TTN MQTT broker

The Things Network provides a built in MQTT broker which you can connect to using your TTN application credentials.
For a more detailed description on that topic, please refer to the 
[TTN MQTT Quick Start](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/mqtt/quick-start.html).

Eclipse Ditto can establish connections to MQTT brokers. This is a schematic picture of what we now will do:

{% include image.html file="../slides/images/ttn-ditto-via-mqtt.png" alt="TTN to Ditto via MQTT" additionalStyle="max-width:600px;padding-left:1em" %}

In order to connect to your own TTN application, perform the following steps.

You can find the `<AppId>` (application ID) and `<AppKey>` (access key) in your TTN console of your application.
For `<Region>`, e.g. choose `'eu'` when your application is in handled by the Handler 'ttn-handler-eu'.
 
Please export your application's credentials locally to environment variables:

```shell
export TTN_REGION='<Region>'
export TTN_APP_ID='<AppID>'
export TTN_APP_KEY='<AppKey>'
```

After having done that, you can already create the connection of Ditto to the TTN MQTT broker:

```shell
curl -X POST -u devops:foobar -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "targetActorSelection": "/system/sharding/connection",

                         "outgoingScript": "function mapFromDittoProtocolMsg() { return null; }",

                     }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}' http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/devops/piggyback/connectivity?timeout=8s
```

Explanation - what is done here:
* using curl with the `devops` (admin) user and its initial password `foobar` we create a connection of type `mqtt` 
(you can find further information on that in Ditto's [MQTT docs](connectivity-protocol-bindings-mqtt.html))
* we use the TTN application credentials in the configured `"uri"`, connect via plain TCP 
  (SSL is also possible but in this case a little more complicated as the server certificate of the TTN MQTT broker
   would have to be imported)
* we add an entry in `"sources"`:
    * defining the MQTT topic (`"addresses"`) to subscribe to
    * specifying in which `"authorizationContext"` messages from this connection shall be executed
    * defining in the `"enforcement"` that, based on the MQTT topic, a device may only update the Ditto twin having the same name
    * declaring that a custom payload mapping shall be applied for each incoming message
* in the `"mappingDefinitions"` we define the previously used "ttn-demo-mapping" as JavaScript based mapping:
    * only an "incoming" script is defined as we don't handle downstream messages to TTN in this example
    * when you want to understand the script in more depth, please take a look at the [details about it](#javascript-payload-mapping-script-in-detail)

{% include tip.html content="As you have other custom `payload_fields` for your TTN devices, please adjust the script 
                             if you want to see the device's custom payload fields in your Ditto twins." %}



## Create a common policy for the twins to be created

Eclipse Ditto secures each API access to the managed twins by applying authorization of the authenticated user.<br/>
Those "rules" which authenticated user may access which twins are defined in [Policies](basic-policy.html).

In order to proceed with our scenario, we create a single Policy which shall be used for all twins we create in a later 
step:

```shell
curl -X PUT -u ditto:ditto -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
   "policyId": "org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo:twin-policy",
   "entries": {
       "USER": {
           "subjects": {
              "nginx:ditto": {
                  "type": "basic auth user authenticated via nginx"
              }
           },
           "resources": {
               "thing:/": {
                   "grant": ["READ", "WRITE"],
                   "revoke": []
               },
               "policy:/": {
                   "grant": ["READ", "WRITE"],
                   "revoke": []
               },
               "message:/": {
                   "grant": ["READ", "WRITE"],
                   "revoke": []
               }
           }
       },
       "TTN": {
           "subjects": {
              "pre-authenticated:ttn-connection": {
                  "type": "used in the connections authorizationContext to the TTN MQTT"
              }
           },
           "resources": {
               "thing:/": {
                   "grant": ["WRITE"],
                   "revoke": []
               }
           }
       }
   }
}' http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/2/policies/org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo:twin-policy
```

Explanation - what is done here:
* we create a new Policy with the ID `"org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo:twin-policy"`
* it contains 2 entries:
    * `"USER"`: this Policy entry contains the authorization information of the user of the twin APIs (authenticated via the contained "nginx" acting as reverse proxy). 
       This user may READ+WRITE the things (twins), this created policy and may also send and receive messages.
    * `"TTN"`: this Policy entry contains the authorization information of the connection to the TTN MQTT broker (the subject was configured as `"authorizationContext"` when we created the connection. 
       This connection may only WRITE (update) the things (twins).


## Create digital twins

Now we have everything in place in order to create digital twins for our devices connected to TTN.

Please export all device ids you want to create digital twins for as comma separated environment variable:
```shell
export TTN_DEVICE_IDS='<comma-separated-list-of-your-device-ids>'
```

After having done that, we can already create the twins in Ditto as the `ditto` user:

```shell
for dev_id in ${TTN_DEVICE_IDS//,/ }
do
    # call your procedure/other scripts here below
    echo "Creating digital twin with Thing ID: org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo:$dev_id"
    curl -X PUT -u ditto:ditto -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
       "policyId": "org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo:twin-policy"
    }' http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo:$dev_id
done
```

Explanation - what is done here:
* we split the passed in `TTN_DEVICE_IDS` environment variable by `,` and iterate over all contained device ids
* for each device ID we create a new Thing (twin) referencing the already previously created Policy 


## Access your digital twins via API

Congratulations, if you have done it so far your TTN devices do now have digital twin representations in Eclipse Ditto.

{% include tip.html content="Install the command line tool `jq` and pipe the output of the below `curl` commands to it in order to get
                             prettified and colored JSON" %}
                              
{% include note.html content="Alternatively to `curl`, you may also use the locally deployed swagger-ui at http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/apidoc/ 
                              in order to try out Ditto's HTTP API - *make sure to select* `/api/2 - local Ditto` in the 'Servers' 
                              section - when asked for credentials, use username 'ditto' and password 'ditto'" %}

You can now, for example, use Ditto's HTTP APIs in order
* to retrieve the latest reported values: `curl -u ditto:ditto http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo:<dev_id>`
* to get a live stream of updates to the twins using SSE (Server Sent Events): `curl --http2 -u ditto:ditto -H 'Accept:text/event-stream' -N http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/2/things`
* to list all available twins via the search API: `curl -u ditto:ditto http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/2/search/things`
    * alternatively, use your browser and open http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/2/search/things
    * when asked for credentials, use username "ditto" and password "ditto"
* formulate a search query, e.g. only searching for twins with a temperature above 24°, sorted by the last modification, the most recent first
  to get the most active twin as first result:
    * `curl -u ditto:ditto "http://localhost:${DITTO_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/2/search/things?filter=gt(features/temperature/properties/value,24.0)&option=sort(-_modified),size(5)&fields=thingId,policyId,attributes,features,_modified,_revision"`


## Which other possibilities do we now have?

Now you have all the possibilities Eclipse Ditto as digital twin framework provides, e.g.:
* directly use your device's data in a web application consuming Ditto's HTTP API
* directly use your device's data in a mobile app using Ditto's bidirectional [WebSocket](httpapi-protocol-bindings-websocket.html)
* make use of the [Eclipse Ditto Java or JavaScript clients](https://github.com/eclpise/ditto-clients/) which also use the WebSocket to integrate your device's data
* create another connection (optionally also applying JavaScript based payload mapping)
    * to e.g. [Apache Kafka](connectivity-protocol-bindings-kafka2.html) and forward all the modifications made to your devices to there
    * or using [HTTP push](connectivity-protocol-bindings-http.html) in order to call another HTTP API (e.g. insert time series data into an InfluxDB via its HTTP API)  

<br/>
<br/>

For time reasons we do not go deeper into additional topics, they are possible however, please consult the Ditto
documentation:
* the WebSocket channel and subscribing for change notifications 
* sending downward messages to devices
* live commands (not retrieving persisted data of devices, but live data)
* a more detailed introduction into authentication mechanisms ([OpenID Connect with OAuth2.0 is possible](installation-operating.html#openid-connect))
* possibilities to configure your Policies on every resource level, e.g. allowing individuals to only access certain values of a twin 
* and many other things..


## Additional resources

### Cleanup after the workshop

Simply perform in the `ditto/deployment/docker` folder:
```shell
docker-compose down
```

And unistall docker + docker-compose (for docker-compose, just remove the downloaded file) again, if you don't need it.

### JavaScript payload mapping script in detail

Similar to the TTN console's decoding/converting capabilities of "Payload Formats" of an TTN application, Ditto is able
to apply a custom JavaScript function for each consumed message.<br/>
That is necessary in order to convert the received data into a [Ditto Protocol](protocol-overview.html) message 
including the JSON hierarchy of a so called [Thing](basic-thing.html) being the representation of a digital twin. 

As the above injected JavaScript payload mapping script is formatted in a single line, this is the script we used pretty
 formatted, including the jsdoc of the provided function and some other inline comments.
 
If you need to adjust the script in order to use your own `payload_fields`, please replace all newlines with `\n` and
escape the single quotes `'` in the script with the following replacement: `'"'"'`. Otherwise the single quotes won't get
correctly escaped in the bash. You can remove the comments before making a single line of the script.


```javascript
/**
 * Maps the passed parameters to a Ditto Protocol message.
 * @param {Object.<string, string>} headers - The headers Object containing all received header values
 * @param {string} [textPayload] - The String to be mapped
 * @param {ArrayBuffer} [bytePayload] - The bytes to be mapped as ArrayBuffer
 * @param {string} [contentType] - The received Content-Type, e.g. "application/json"
 * @returns {(DittoProtocolMessage|Array<DittoProtocolMessage>)} dittoProtocolMessage(s) -
 *  The mapped Ditto Protocol message,
 *  an array of Ditto Protocol messages or
 *  <code>null</code> if the message could/should not be mapped
 */
function mapToDittoProtocolMsg(
  headers,
  textPayload,
  bytePayload,
  contentType
) {

  let ttnJson = JSON.parse(textPayload);          // we simply parse the incoming TTN message as JSON
  let deviceId = ttnJson['dev_id'];               // and extract some fields we require
  let payloadFields = ttnJson['payload_fields'];  // the 'payload_fields' content is - obviously - different for your application

  let thing = {                                   // a Thing can contain both attributes and features
    attributes: attributesObj,
    features: featuresObj
  };
  
  let dittoHeaders = {
    'response-required': false,     // we don't expect a response sent back to TTN
    'If-Match': '*'                 // we only want to update the thing if it already exists
  };

  return Ditto.buildDittoProtocolMsg(
    'org.eclipse.ditto.ttn.demo',   // this is the namespace used as prefix for Ditto Thing IDs
    deviceId,                       // the TTN device ID is used as "name" part of the Ditto Thing ID 
    'things',
    'twin',
    'commands',
    'modify',
    '/',
    dittoHeaders,
    thing
  );
}
```
