A warm welcome, dear visitor, to our new project site. 

The initial contribution of the Ditto codebase was one month ago and we did show the Digital twins a little on
EclipseCon Europe in Ludwigsburg.<br/>
Meanwhile we worked on setting up the project site and documentation which we have now finished from the technical side.

The [HTTP API Documentation](http-api-doc.html) is already complete and describes both of our API versions 1 and 2.

Next we focus on releasing a first Milestone `0.1.0-M1` including images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/eclipse/)
so that you can try out Eclipse Ditto more easily without building it first.

We are looking forward to any feedback you have via our [Feedback channels](feedback.html).
